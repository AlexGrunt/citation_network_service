are many factors that affect the probability of being uncited during the first years after publication. In this study, we analyze three of these factors for journals, conference proceedings and book series: the field (in 316 subject categories of the Scopus database), the access modality (open access vs. paywalled), and the visibility of the source (through the percentile of the average impact in the subject category). We quantify the effect of these factors on the probability of being uncited. This probability is measured through the percentage of uncited documents in the serial sources of the Scopus database at about two years after publication. As a main result, we do not find any strong correlation between open access and uncitedness. Within the group of most cited journals (Q1 and top 10%), open access journals generally have somewhat lower uncited rates. However, in the intermediate quartiles (Q2 and Q3) almost no differences are observed, while for Q4 the uncited rate is again somewhat lower in the case of the OA group. This is important because it provides new evidence in the debate about open access citation advantage.","9589":"  The Helfrich energy is commonly used to model the elastic bending energy of lipid bilayers in membrane mechanics. The governing differential equations for certain geometric characteristics of the shape of the membrane can be obtained by applying variational methods (minimization principles) to the Helfrich energy functional and are well-studied in the axisymmetric framework. However, the Helfrich energy functional and the resulting differential equations involve a number of parameters, and there is little explanation of the choice of parameters in the literature, particularly with respect to the choice of the \"spontaneous curvature\" term that appears in the functional. In this paper, we present a careful analytical and numerical study of certain aspects of parametric sensitivity of Helfrich's Using simulations of specific model systems, we demonstrate the application of our scheme to the formation of spherical buds and pearled shapes in membrane vesicles. ","15088":"Securing confidential information over an unsecured communication channel and environment has become an essential aspect. This paper proposes high-capacity audio steganography model based on fractal coding and uniform coefficient modulation, which will be called as HASFC, that simultaneously adjusts the data hiding requirements by increasing the hiding capacity while maintaining the transparency and robustness. HASFC model is based on cover-secret mapping, uniform coefficients modulation and hybrid chaotic map techniques in the transform domain using lifting wavelet. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated using a set of experiments, and the audio files are selected from the GTZAN dataset. The empirical findings show improvement in hiding capacity by 30% in comparison with similar techniques in the wavelet domain. Moreover, the transparency is preserved with 50\u00a0dB SNR and 4.8 SDG, on average. Furthermore, the proposed model is robust to some signal processing attacks and steganalysis using statistical methods such as the fourth first moment and histogram error ratio. The results signify that the proposed model has notably enhanced the performance of the audio steganography comparing with the related works.","15210":"In this article, a new system diminution technique is proposed for the reduction in complexity and controller design of the higher-order models. This method is based on the Mihailov stability method which ensures the stability of the obtained simplified\/micro-model if the higher-order plant is stable. In this technique, the reduced characteristic equation of the simplified plant is obtained by using the Mihailov stability technique and the reduced numerator equation is determined by using the improved Pad\u00e9 approximation technique. By using this reduced-order model, the PID controller is designed for the large-scale system. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated by comparing the step responses of the complete and lower-order models. The performance of the recommended technique is shown in terms of step responses and performance error indices. Three standard numerical systems are finally provided to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the designed controller and the performance of the proposed model-order reduction technique.","15441":"This study presents both static and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms for the design of event-triggered stabilizing state feedback controllers for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. Sufficient conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are first provided to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The controllers are then systematically designed. We also prove that the inter-event intervals of the considered event-triggered mechanisms are positive, therefore ensuring that the Zeno behavior does not happen. Two examples with simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.","15685":"This paper presents a copyright protection and integrity verification watermarking scheme for color images. It uses the extracted features of the host image to generate a watermark, which is then embedded in the host image to produce a watermarked image. We have inserted the watermark in the frequency domain using discrete cosine transform. The choice of the positions of the watermark bits depends on a preprocessing study on the original and compressed\u2013decompressed image. Then, we have implemented a blind detection algorithm. In order to counter rotation and cropping attacks, our scheme adopts Speeded-Up Robust Feature to locate invariant key points. The latter are extracted from the original image and used as part of the keys of our scheme to resynchronize only watermarked image altered by rotation and cropping. The robustness and integrity of our method are tested by executing Stirmark 3.1 attacks to the watermarked images. The experimental results show that our method affords a high level of imperceptibility and robustness against JPEG compression, unique and double Stirmark attacks.","15737":"The electrocardiogram is an important tool that is widely used for diagnosis of many cardiovascular diseases. In this context, QRS complex detection is a very crucial step in the ECG diagnosis system. The major aim of this work is to develop a novel method for QRS complex detection under various ECG signal morphologies as well as under different ECG recording conditions, including numerous noise sources and varying QRS waveforms. The proposed algorithm is based principally on the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and Teager energy operator (TEO). In our scheme, SWT is first used for ECG signal preprocessing and QRS complex frequency content localization. Subsequently, a novel process for R peak detection based on TEO and a moving average (MA) filter is introduced. More precisely, SWT is coupled with TEO and the MA filter to construct a smoothed detection mask. Then, after the mask segmentation and adaptive thresholding steps, R peak times are identified using the maxima detected on the created mask and employing a reference ECG signal. At this stage, efficient decision rules are applied for reducing the number of false alarms. In the experiments, we validate the proposed method on the well-known annotated MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The experimental results show that the newly proposed algorithm provides satisfactory detection performances compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods, with an average sensitivity of 99.84%, average positive predictivity (P+) of \n$$99.87\\%$$\n\n, detection error rate of 0.30% and an overall detection accuracy of 99.70%. Also, the proposed method presents a low computational time complexity with an average processing time of 12 s on each ECG record from MITDB.","15809":"For a class of uncertain differential spatially interconnected systems in the particular case of active electrical ladder circuits, the problem of iterative learning control with stability and robust performance specifications in finite frequency ranges is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the dynamics are converted to an equivalent differential linear repetitive process. Then, based on the Kalman\u2013Yakubovich\u2013Popov Lemma, a control law design algorithm is presented in the form of the corresponding linear matrix inequalities. Since the system parameters are norm-bounded uncertain, an extension to robust control law is also discussed. The resulting dynamics satisfy the robust performance specifications, and the error monotonically converges in finite frequency ranges with the robust iterative learning control law. Finally, a control simulation of an active electrical ladder circuit is presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.","16428":"","16826":"","17112":"","17123":"Orthogonal moments have become a powerful tool for object representation and image analysis. Radial harmonic Fourier moments (RHFMs) are one of such image descriptors based on a set of orthogonal projection bases, which outperform other moments because of their computational efficiency. However, the conventional computational framework of RHFMs produces geometric error and numerical integration error, which will affect the accuracy of RHFMs, thus degrading the image reconstruction performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new computational framework of RHFMs, namely accurate quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (AQRHFMs), for color image processing, and also analyze the properties of AQRHFMs. Firstly, we propose a precise computation method of RHFMs to reduce the geometric and numerical errors. Secondly, by using the algebra of quaternions, we extend the accurate RHFMs to AQRHFMs in order to deal with the color images in a holistic manner. Experimental results show the proposed AQRHFMs achieve promising performance in image reconstruction and object recognition in both noise-free and noisy conditions.","17859":"Reversible logic is considered as a basic requirement for designing quantum computers. Reversible circuits do not waste energy. The use of this logic in low-power complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor circuits, quantum computing, and DNA computing has rendered reversible logic integral in today\u2019s technology. Multiplication is regarded as a major operation in the arithmetic. Herein, four optimized parity-preserving reversible signed and unsigned multiplier circuits are presented to reduce the QUANTUM COST of the circuits. The designs can be expanded to an N\u2009\u00d7\u2009N dimension. We prove that these multiplier circuits have lower QUANTUM COST, CONSTANT INPUTs, and GARBAGE OUTPUTs compared with previous studies.","17875":"The ambiguity function (AF) is an essential time-frequency analysis tool to analyze the radar waveform properties in radar applications. It can be used effectively and reliably to analyze properties like the peak-to-side-lobe ratio, time delay resolution, Doppler resolution and tolerance characteristic. However, it fails to analyze higher-order chirp waveforms and is unable to estimate their parameters. To solve this problem, a generalized time-frequency transform-based generalized fractional AF (GFAF) and generalized fractional Wigner\u2013Ville distribution (GFWVD) are proposed. GFAF is also a generalization of the Fourier transform-based ambiguity function and the fractional Fourier transform-based ambiguity function. The uncertainty principle for GFAF and GFWVD is derived. Examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of GFAF in analyzing cubic chirp waveforms and estimating parameters of multicomponent cubic chirps. The superiority of GFAF is demonstrated by comparing the mean square error to Cramer\u2013Rao lower bound and high-order ambiguity function under different input-signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The robustness is demonstrated by comparing the signal-to-noise ratio gain to that of the time domain-matched filtering and other ambiguity functions. Finally, fourth-order parameters of a real bat echolocation signal are estimated.","18086":"","18238":"","18455":"","18499":"","18735":"We propose a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, the Joint Matting Network (JMNet), to automatically generate alpha mattes for human images.

This algorithm combines the processes of ear-sides noise reconstruction and ANC. First, to reduce non-stationarity and nonlinearity, multi-source noise signals outside the vehicle are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Second, the IMFs are reconstructed by the energy-extreme division method into three components: high-frequency, intermediate-frequency and low-frequency. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) parameters are adjusted by the proportions of the components. Model training is performed to obtain the high-precision EMD\u2013RBFNN reconstruction model (EMD\u2013NNRM). The reconstructed noise signal is used as the reference signal of the variable step-size least mean square (VSS-LMS) algorithm, to control the passenger ear-sides noise. The effectiveness of the EMD\u2013NNRM is validated using four noise signals from the outside of a vehicle. The interior noise of a high-speed vehicle is processed by the proposed algorithm and the traditional VSS-LMS algorithm for comparison. The reconstruction results show that the mean absolute error is improved by 77.64% compared with the back propagation neural network reconstruction model. Reconstructed passenger ear-sides noise can be utilized for ANC. The active control results suggest that the proposed algorithm can not only effectively suppress the interior noise but can also avoid pollution from secondary sound sources.","18911":"This paper studies the general decay synchronization (GDS) of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with general activation functions and mixed time delays.

Their misconceptions are also notable. On the other hand, mobile devices (such as tablets) and their apps, are considered effective educational tools. For examining whether the same holds true in relation to plants, we carried out a project, having as a target-group 263 students aged 11\u201312, divided into five groups. Two were taught using printed material, one using laptops and webpages, while the last two were taught using tablets (one with a commercial app and one with a tailor-made one). We chose Bybee\u2019s 5Es as the teaching framework for all groups except the first, in which lecturing was applied. Six two-hour sessions were allocated in each group. We collected data through evaluation sheets and a questionnaire. The results suggested that students in the tablets groups established a solid base of declarative and procedural knowledge regarding plants. Their misconceptions were eased, at least when compared with the groups that used printed material. We also observed a positive impact on motivation and enjoyment. On the basis of the findings, we recommend the active involvement of teachers in the development of apps and the corresponding learning material, so as to be able to gain valuable insights on how mobile learning is implemented. We also propose a teaching framework that would allow the full exploitation of mobile devices\u2019 advantages.","18940":"Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have powerful capability of learning complex feature representations, they are limited by poor ability in handling large rotations and scale transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative to conventional convolutional layer named Gabor convolutional layer (GCL) to enhance the robustness to transformations. The GCL is a simple but efficient combination of Gabor prior knowledge and parameters learning. A GCL is composed of three components: Gabor extraction module, weight-sharing convolution module, and transformation pooling module, respectively. DCNNs integrated with GCLs, referred to as transformation-invariant Gabor convolutional networks (TI-GCNs), can be easily built by replacing standard convolutional layers with designed GCLs. Our experimental results on various real-world recognition tasks indicate that encoding traditional hand-crafted Gabor filters with dominant orientation and scale information into DCNNs is of great importance for learning compact feature representations and reinforcing the resistance to scale changes and orientation variations.

The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","19079":"","19113":"","19200":"In the era of big data, stock markets are closely connected with Internet big data from diverse sources. This paper makes the first attempt to compare the linkage between stock markets and various Internet big data collected from search engines, public media and social media.

Taking the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange as targets for stock markets, web search data, news, and microblogs as samples of Internet big data, some interesting findings can be obtained. 1) There is a strong bi-directional, linear and nonlinear Granger causality between stock markets and investors\u2019 web search behaviors due to some similar trends and uncertain factors. 2) News sentiments from public media have Granger causality with stock markets in a bi-directional linear way, while microblog sentiments from social media have Granger causality with stock markets in a unidirectional linear way, running from stock markets to microblog sentiments. 3) News sentiments can explain the changes in stock markets better than microblog sentiments due to their authority.

Therefore, the long electric dipole and large magnetic loop for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation are investigated in this study. A novel array composed of long electric dipole, large magnetic loop, or a hybrid long electric dipole and large magnetic loop is proposed. Then a corresponding algorithm based on ESPRIT is proposed to estimate the two-dimensional (2D) DOA. The proposed array has eight elements. The first four elements and other four elements construct the rotational invariant property. Then, the 2D direction cosine can be estimated accurately but with ambiguity. After that, the ambiguous value is instituted into the spatially spread vector sensor for spatial phase compensation. Then, the steering vector of the collocated orthogonal vector sensor is obtained to calculate a fake coarse DOA estimation. By comparing the above ambiguous fine estimation with the fake coarse estimation, the closest estimation is taken as the finally 2D DOA estimation. The computation of the proposed algorithm is small due to a lack of angle searching. Moreover, the long dipole has high radiation efficiency, and the spatially spread vector sensor has low mutual coupling. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","19494":"In social networks, the structural balance is a state of a group of individuals (nodes) with established mutual relationships (connection relationships) between them. It is easy to see that a social network can be described by a complex dynamical network model composed of the nodes subsystem (NS) and the connection relationships subsystem (CS), where the two subsystems are usually coupled with each other. It implies that the dynamic changes of nodes\u2019 states may cause the structural balance in CS. However, few papers have discussed the relationship between the structural balance and the specific dynamic changes of the nodes\u2019 states. This paper proposes a model of complex dynamical networks, and mainly focuses on the dynamic changes of states in NS which can lead to the structural balance in CS. It is proved that if each state in NS is doing a specific dynamic motion via the controller with the parameter adaptive law, then the CS can track a given structural balance matrix via the effective coupling and the structural balance can be achieved. Such a result can be regarded as an explanation of the relationship between the structural balance and the specific dynamic changes of the nodes\u2019 states. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","19554":"In this paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is considered to solve the tracking problem of time-varying linear stochastic systems with randomly varying trial lengths. Using the two-dimensional Kalman filtering technique, the authors can establish a recursive framework for designing the learning gain matrix along both time and iteration axes by optimizing the trace of input error covariance matrix. It is strictly proved that the input error converges to zero asymptotically in mean square sense and thus the tracking error covariance converges. The extensions to that prior distribution of nonuniform trial lengths is unknown are also investigated with an asymptotical estimation method. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","19763":"Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) are a promising modeling tool for knowledge representation and reasoning. As a new type of FPNs, bipolar fuzzy Petri nets (BFPNs) are developed in this article to overcome the shortcomings and improve the performance of traditional FPNs. In order to depict expert knowledge more accurately, the BFPN model adopts bipolar fuzzy sets (BFSs), which are characterized by the satisfaction degree to property and the satisfaction degree to its counter property, to represent knowledge parameters. Because of the increasing scale of expert systems, a concurrent hierarchical reasoning algorithm is introduced to simplify the structure of BFPNs and reduce the computation complexity of knowledge reasoning algorithm. In addition, a large group expert weighting method is proposed for knowledge acquisition by taking experts\u2019 non-cooperative behaviors into account. A realistic case of risk index evaluation system is presented to show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed BFPNs.

Motivated by the linear prediction property of the signal cross-covariance matrix, the 2-D DOA estimation problem is equivalently converted into a 2-D frequency estimation problem. With the QR decomposition technique, the closed-form solutions in the transform domain with respect to the azimuth and elevation angles are successively estimated using the weighted least squared method as the solver, and it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves automatically pairing while permitting fast implementation.

This paper shows a lengthy nested NER problem of element tagging on insurance policy (ETIP). Compared to NER, ETIP deals with not only different types of entities which vary from a short phrase to a long sentence, but also phrase or clause entities that could be nested. We present a novel hybrid framework of deep learning and heuristic filtering method to recognize the lengthy nested elements. First, a convolutional neural network is constructed to obtain good initial candidates of sliding windows with high softmax probability. Then, the concatenation operator on adjacent candidate segments is introduced to create phrase, clause, or sentence candidates. We design an effective voting strategy to resolve the classification conflict of the concatenated candidates and present a theoretical proof of F1-score optimization. In experiments, we have collected a large Chinese insurance contract dataset to test the performance of the proposed method. An extensive set of experiments is performed to investigate how sliding window candidates can work effectively in our filtering and voting strategy. The optimal parameters are determined by statistical analysis of the experimental data. The results show the promising performance of our method in the ETIP problem.","20388":"A common approach to controller synthesis for hybrid systems is to first establish a discrete-event abstraction and then to use methods from supervisory control theory to synthesise a controller. In this paper, we consider behavioural abstractions of hybrid systems with a prescribed discrete-event input\/output interface. We discuss a family of abstractions based on so called experiments which consist of samples from the external behaviour of the hybrid system. The special feature of our setting is that the accuracy of the abstraction can be carefully adapted to suit the particular control problem at hand. Technically, this is implemented as an iteration in which we alternate trial control synthesis with abstraction refinement. While localising refinement to where it is intuitively needed, we can still formally establish that the overall iteration will solve the control problem, provided that an abstraction-based solution exists at all.","20586":"Human action recognition remains an important yet challenging task. This work proposes a novel action recognition system. It uses a novel multi-view region-adaptive multi-resolution-in-time depth motion map (MV-RAMDMM) formulation combined with appearance information. Multi-stream 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained on the different views and time resolutions of the region-adaptive depth motion maps. Multiple views are synthesised to enhance the view invariance. The region-adaptive weights, based on localised motion, accentuate and differentiate parts of actions possessing faster motion. Dedicated 3D CNN streams for multi-time resolution appearance information are also included. These help to identify and differentiate between small object interactions. A pre-trained 3D-CNN is used here with fine-tuning for each stream along with multi-class support vector machines. Average score fusion is used on the output. The developed approach is capable of recognising both human action and human\u2013object interaction. Three public-domain data-sets, namely MSR 3D Action, Northwestern UCLA multi-view actions and MSR 3D daily activity, are used to evaluate the proposed solution.

This paper presents a new method for distinguishing RF devices by combining transfer learning and long short-term memory (TL-LSTM). The main purpose of this paper is to identify which RF device sent the unknown RF signals. The data were collected from almost the same eight RF devices produced in 2011, 2014 or 2016. These RF devices emitted unintended signals at 2.4G bandwidth with frequency shift keying. The proposed method first used late production RF devices in 2011 or 2014 as source domain and transferred the trained model to target domain produced in 2016 and then used neural network LSTM model to identify the RF signals. The proposed method is advantageous because it does not require a huge amount of sampling data, and this technique is better than traditional strategies to select optimal features in the multi-domain feature space.

Most of the attention has been dedicated to seeking the domain-invariant features of cross-domain data, but they ignores the valuable discriminative information in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a Discriminative Dictionary Evolution (DDE) approach to seek discriminative features robust to domain shift. Specifically, DDE gradually adapts a discriminative dictionary learned from the source domain to the target domain through a dictionary evolving procedure, in which self-selected atoms of the dictionary are updated with \n$$\\ell _{2,1}$$\n\n-norm-based regularization. DDE produces domain-invariant representations for cross-domain visual recognition meanwhile promotes the discriminativeness of the dictionary. Empirical results on real-world data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over existing competitive methods.","21113":"Twin extreme learning machine (TELM) has attracted considerable attention and achieved great success in the machine learning field. However, its performance will be severely affected when outliers exist in the dataset since TELM does not consider heteroscedasticity in practical applications. To improve the performance of TELM, a novel learning framework called twin parametric-margin extreme learning machine (TPMELM) was proposed. Further, to enhance the classification performance of our TPMELM in a semi-supervised learning setting, a Laplacian TPMELM (Lap-TPMELM) was developed by introducing manifold regularization into TPMELM. Using the geometric information of the marginal distribution embedded in unlabeled samples, Lap-TPMELM can effectively construct a more reasonable classifier. The TPMELM and Lap-TPMELM are suitable for many situations, especially when the data has heteroscedastic error structure. Moreover, the TPMELM and Lap-TPMELM are helpful in clarifying theoretical interpretation of parameters which control the bounds on proportions of support vectors and boundary errors. An efficient technique (successive over-relaxation, SOR) is applied in TPMELM and Lap-TPMELM, respectively. Experimental results show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methods.","21247":"This paper presents a novel low complex configuration methodology by deploying a directed minimal spanning tree (DMST) algorithm for designing digital multiplierless finite impulse response filter.

The attractive feature of this work lays on the detailed comparison of the cost, reconstruction error, pass-band and stop-band error by exploiting various evolutionary techniques such as cuckoo search algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee intelligence, hybrid swarm optimization and flower pollination algorithm; followed by employing hybrid SID and DMST on these techniques. For this purpose, a mean squared error-based objective function is optimized in the pass-band and stop-band region of the filter. Further, a detailed comparison of hybrid SID and DMST with other existing CSE algorithms is also illustrated. It has been observed that up to 80% reduction in number of adders can be accomplished using the proposed DMST-based approach for multiplierless filter design.","21412":"Many content-based image retrieval (CBIR) methods are being developed to store more and more information about images in shorter feature vectors and to improve image retrieval rate. In the proposed method, two-step approach to CBIR has been developed. The first step generates an image mask from local binary pattern (LBP). This LBP mask is then utilized to draw comparison between the centre pixel and the eight surrounding pixels. The second step involves drawing the peak and valley patterns of local directional binary pattern for each image which is then combined with the colour histogram to retrieve similar images. Existing methods suffer from lower average image retrieval accuracy even with larger feature vectors. The proposed method overcomes such problems through shorter feature vectors that can store more information about the image. As illustrated through experimental results, the proposed method produces promising results with shorter feature vector of length 56 and improved image retrieval rate of about 5\u201310%.

Automatic plagiarism detection systems are crucial for ensuring the integrity and genuineness of intellectual work. There are different types of plagiarism, such as copy\u2013paste, obfuscation and translation. In particular, obfuscated text is one of the hardest types of plagiarism to detect. In this paper, we propose an automatic plagiarism detection system for obfuscated text based on a support vector machine classifier that exploits a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system on benchmark English and Arabic corpora made available by the PAN Workshop series: PAN 2012, PAN 2013, PAN 2014 and PAN@FIRE2015.

Recently, a considerable amount of literature has been published on subspace clustering to address this challenge. The main objective of the subspace clustering is to discover clusters embedded in any possible combination of the attributes. Previous studies have mostly been generating redundant subspace clusters, leading to clustering accuracy loss and also increasing the running time. In this paper, a bottom-up density-based approach is proposed for clustering of high-dimensional data. We employ the cluster structure as a similarity measure to generate the optimal subspaces which result in raising the accuracy of the subspace clustering. Using this idea, we propose an iterative algorithm to discover similar subspaces using the similarity in the features of subspaces. At each iteration of this algorithm, it first determines similar subspaces, then combines them to generate higher-dimensional subspaces, and finally re-clusters the subspaces. The algorithm repeats these steps and converges to the final clusters. Experiments on various synthetic and real datasets show that the results of the proposed approach are significantly better in both quality and runtime comparing to the state of the art on clustering high-dimensional data. The accuracy of the proposed method is around 34% higher than the CLIQUE algorithm and around 6% higher than DiSH.","21569":"Local processing of machine learning algorithms like support vector machine (SVM) is preferred over the cloud for many real-time embedded applications.

These design techniques helped the learning unit to achieve 46.97% and 35.72% reductions in area and power when compared with those of the design using full multipliers. The proposed SVM learning unit supports on-chip training and classification. Energy-efficient dual-core, quad-core and octa-core cascade SVM systems were developed using the proposed SVM learning unit to expedite the on-chip training process. The runtime and energy efficiency of the cascade SVM systems improved with an increase in the number of cores. Interestingly, an average speedup of 421x in training time and a remarkable energy reduction of 24,497x were observed for the octa-core cascade SVM system when compared with the software SVM solution running on Intel Core i5-5257U processor. Moreover, the proposed octa-core cascade SVM system showed 73.75% and 65.78% lower area and power, respectively, than those of state-of-the-art cascade SVM architecture.","21919":"","22775":"Lower-limb assisted exoskeletons are widely researched for movement assistance or rehabilitation training. Due to advantages of compliance with human body and lightweight, some cable-driven prototypes have been developed, but most of these can assist only unidirectional movement. In this paper we present an untethered cable-driven ankle exoskeleton that can achieve plantarflexion-dorsiflexion bidirectional motion bilaterally using a pair of single motors. The main weights of the exoskeleton, i.e., the motors, power supplement units, and control units, were placed close to the proximity of the human body, i.e., the waist, to reduce the redundant rotation inertia which would apply on the wearer\u2019s leg. A cable force transmission system based on gear-pulley assemblies was designed to transfer the power from the motor to the end-effector effectively. A cable self-tension device on the power output unit was designed to tension the cable during walking. The gait detection system based on a foot pressure sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) could identify the gait cycle and gait states efficiently. To validate the power output performance of the exoskeleton, a torque tracking experiment was conducted. When the subject was wearing the exoskeleton with power on, the muscle activity of the soleus was reduced by 5.2% compared to the state without wearing the exoskeleton. This preliminarily verifies the positive assistance effect of our exoskeleton.

The hybrid unmanned underwater vehicle, Haidou, is developed to perform scientific survey at the deepest parts of the Earth oceans. For vehicles working at the full-ocean depth, acoustic positioning is the most effective and popular method. The 11 000 m class acoustic positioning system is relatively massive and complex, and it requires specialized research vessels equipped with compatible acoustic instruments. As a compact testbed platform, it is impractical for Haidou to carry an LBL\/USBL beacon with its large volume and weight. During the descent to about 11 000 m, horizontal drift could not be eliminated because of the hydrodynamics and uncertain ocean currents in the sea trials. The maximum depth recorded by Haidou is 10 905 m, and determining the precise location of the deepest point is challenging. With the bathymetric map produced by a multibeam sonar, the terrain contour matching (TERCOM) method is adopted for terrain matching localization. TERCOM is stable in providing an accurate position because of its insensitivity to the initial position errors. The final matching results show the best estimate of location in the reference terrain map.","22786":"Accurate acceleration acquisition is a critical issue in the robotic exoskeleton system, but it is difficult to directly obtain the acceleration via the existing sensing systems. The existing algorithm-based acceleration acquisition methods put more attention on finite-time convergence and disturbance suppression but ignore the error constraint and initial state irrelevant techniques. To this end, a novel radical bias function neural network (RBFNN) based fixed-time reconstruction scheme with error constraints is designed to realize high-performance acceleration estimation. In this scheme, a novel exponential-type barrier Lyapunov function is proposed to handle the error constraints. It also provides a unified and concise Lyapunov stability-proof template for constrained and non-constrained systems. Moreover, a fractional power sliding mode control law is designed to realize fixed-time convergence, where the convergence time is irrelevant to initial states or external disturbance, and depends only on the chosen parameters. To further enhance observer robustness, an RBFNN with the adaptive weight matrix is proposed to approximate and attenuate the completely unknown disturbances. Numerical simulation and human subject experimental results validate the unique properties and practical robustness.","22789":"This paper summarizes the autonomous guidance methods (AGMs) for pinpoint soft landing on celestial surfaces. We first review the development of powered descent guidance methods, focusing on their contributions for dealing with constraints and enhancing computational efficiency. With the increasing demand for reusable launchers and more scientific returns from space exploration, pinpoint soft landing has become a basic requirement. Unlike the kilometer-level precision for previous activities, the position accuracy of future planetary landers is within tens of meters of a target respecting all constraints of velocity and attitude, which is a very difficult task and arouses renewed interest in AGMs. This paper states the generalized three- and six-degree-of-freedom optimization problems in the powered descent phase and compares the features of three typical scenarios, i.e., the lunar, Mars, and Earth landing. On this basis, the paper details the characteristics and adaptability of AGMs by comparing aspects of analytical guidance methods, numerical optimization algorithms, and learning-based methods, and discusses the convexification treatment and solution strategies for non-convex problems. Three key issues related to AGM application, including physical feasibility, model accuracy, and real-time performance, are presented afterward for discussion. Many space organizations, such as those in the United States, China, France, Germany, and Japan, have also developed free-flying demonstrators to carry out related research.

In addition, a dimension-dependent parameter setting method is adopted to improve the blindness of parameter setting. We simulate the flight process of five UAVs in a complex obstacle environment.

Obstacle detection is a complicated task, which involves the diversity of obstacles, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions. While the on-road driver assistance system or autonomous driving system has been well researched, the methods developed for the structured road of city scenes may fail in an off-road environment because of its uncertainty and diversity. A single type of sensor finds it hard to satisfy the needs of obstacle detection because of the sensing limitations in range, signal features, and working conditions of detection, and this motivates researchers and engineers to develop multi\u2013sensor fusion and system integration methodology. This survey aims at summarizing the main considerations for the onboard multi-sensor configuration of intelligent ground vehicles in the off-road environments and providing users with a guideline for selecting sensors based on their performance requirements and application environments.

In particular, we put forward a more reasonable and effective pheromone update mechanism, by improving digital pheromone fusion algorithms for different semantic pheromones and planning individuals\u2019 probabilistic behavioral decision-making schemes. Also, inspired by the flocking model in nature, considering the limitations of some individuals in perception and communication, we design a navigation algorithm model on top of Olfati-Saber\u2019s algorithm for flocking control, by further replacing the pheromone scalar to a vector. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can yield superior performance in terms of coverage, detection and revisit efficiency, and the capability of obstacle avoidance.","25176":"Training of generative adversarial network (GAN) on a video dataset is a challenge because of the sheer size of the dataset and the complexity of each observation. In general, the computational cost of training GAN scales exponentially with the resolution. In this study, we present a novel memory efficient method of unsupervised learning of high-resolution video dataset whose computational cost scales only linearly with the resolution. We achieve this by designing the generator model as a stack of small sub-generators and training the model in a specific way. We train each sub-generator with its own specific discriminator. At the time of the training, we introduce between each pair of consecutive sub-generators an auxiliary subsampling layer that reduces the frame-rate by a certain ratio. This procedure can allow each sub-generator to learn the distribution of the video at different levels of resolution. We also need only a few GPUs to train a highly complex generator that far outperforms the predecessor in terms of inception scores.","25908":"The solution of the inverse problem of electrocardiology allows the reconstruction of the spatial distribution of the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface electrocardiogram (electrocardiographic imaging, ECGI). ECGI using the equivalent dipole layer (EDL) model has shown to be accurate for cardiac activation times. However, validation of this method to determine repolarization times is lacking. In the present study, we determined the accuracy of the EDL model in reconstructing cardiac repolarization times, and assessed the robustness of the method under less ideal conditions (addition of noise and errors in tissue conductivity). A monodomain model was used to determine the transmembrane potentials in three different excitation-repolarization patterns (sinus beat and ventricular ectopic beats) as the gold standard. These were used to calculate the body surface ECGs using a finite element model. The resulting body surface electrograms (ECGs) were used as input for the EDL-based inverse reconstruction of repolarization times. The reconstructed repolarization times correlated well (COR\u2009>\u20090.85) with the gold standard, with almost no decrease in correlation after adding errors in tissue conductivity of the model or noise to the body surface ECG. Therefore, ECGI using the EDL model allows adequate reconstruction of cardiac repolarization times.","26786":"The cholinesterases are essential targets implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In the present study, virtual screening and molecular docking are performed to identify the potential hits. Docking-post processing (DPP) and pose filtration protocols against AChE and BChE resulted in three hits (AW00308, HTS04089, and JFD03947). Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) and molecular dynamics simulation analysis affirmed the stability and binding pattern of the docked complex JFD03947, which was further synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cholinesterase inhibition (AChE, IC50\u2009=\u20090.062 \u00b5M; BChE, IC50\u2009=\u20091.482 \u00b5M) activity. The enzyme kinetics study of the JFD03947 against hAChE and hBChE suggested a mixed type of inhibition. The results of thioflavin T-assay also elicited anti-A\u03b2 aggregation activity by JFD03947. Further, biological evaluation of identified compound JFD03947 also showed neuroprotective ability against the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines.","28358":"Activity cliffs (ACs) consist of structurally similar compounds with a large difference in potency against their target. Accordingly, ACs introduce discontinuity in structure-activity relationships (SARs) and are a prime source of SAR information. In compound data sets, the vast majority of ACs are formed by differently sized groups of structurally similar compounds with large potency variations. As a consequence, many of these compounds participate in multiple ACs. This coordinated formation of ACs increases their SAR information content compared to ACs considered as individual compound pairs, but complicates AC analysis. In network representations, coordinated ACs give rise to clusters of varying size and topology, which can be interactively and computationally analyzed. While AC networks are indispensable tools to study coordinated ACs, they become difficult to navigate and interpret in the presence of clusters of increasing size and complex topologies. Herein, we introduce reduced network representations that transform AC networks into an easily interpretable format from which SAR information in the form of R-group tables can be readily obtained. The simplified network variant greatly improves the interpretability of large and complex AC networks and substantially supports SAR exploration.","31003":"The use of waterjet technology is now prevalent in medical applications including surgery, soft tissue resection, bone cutting, waterjet steerable needles, and wound debridement. The depth of the cut (DOC) of a waterjet in soft tissue is an important parameter that should be predicted in these applications. For instance, for waterjet-assisted surgery, selective cutting of tissue layers is a must to avoid damage to deeper tissue layers. For our proposed fracture-directed waterjet steerable needles, predicting the cut depth of the waterjet in soft tissue is important to develop an accurate motion model, as well as control algorithms for this class of steerable needles. To date, most of the proposed models are only valid in the conditions of the experiments and if the soft tissue or the system properties change, the models will become invalid. The model proposed in this paper is formulated to allow for variation in parameters related to both the waterjet geometry and the tissue. In this paper, first the cut depths of waterjet in soft tissue simulants are measured experimentally, and the effect of tissue stiffness, waterjet velocity, and nozzle diameter are studied on DOC. Then, a model based on the properties of the tissue and the waterjet is proposed to predict the DOC of waterjet in soft tissue. In order to verify the model, soft tissue properties (constitutive response and fracture toughness) are measured using low strain rate compression tests, Split-Hopkinson-Pressure-Bar (SHPB) tests, and fracture toughness tests. The results show that the proposed model can predict the DOC of waterjet in soft tissue with acceptable accuracy if the tissue and waterjet properties are known.","33443":"Optimization in medicinal chemistry often involves designing replacements for a section of a molecule which aim to retain potency while improving other properties of the compound. In this study, we perform a retrospective analysis using a number of computational methods to identify active side chains amongst a pool of random decoy side chains, mimicking a similar procedure that might be undertaken in a real medicinal chemistry project. We constructed a dataset derived from public ChEMBL and PDB data by identifying all ChEMBL assays where at least one of the compounds tested has also been co-crystallized in the PDB. Additionally, we required that there be at least ten active compounds tested in the same ChEMBL assay that are matched molecular pairs to the crystallized ligand. Using the compiled dataset consisting of sets of compounds from 402 assays, we have tested a number of methods for scoring side chains including Spark, a bioisostere replacement tool from Cresset, molecular docking using Glide from Schrodinger, docking with Smina, as well as other methods. In this work, we present a comparison of the performance of these methods in discriminating active side chains from decoys as well as recommendations for circumstances when different methods should be used.","33447":"This study is directed toward assessing the predictive potential of eigenvalue-based topological molecular descriptors. The graph energy, Estrada index, resolvent energy, and the Laplacian energy were tested as parameters for the prediction of boiling points, heats of formation, and octanol\/water partition coefficients of alkanes. It was shown that an eigenvalue-based molecular descriptor cannot be individually used for successful prediction of these physico-chemical properties, but the first Zagreb index, the number of zeros in the spectrum and the number of methyl groups must be also involved in the models. Performed statistics show that the models constructed using the Estrada index and resolvent energy are significantly better than ones with the energy of a graph and the Laplacian energy. Such a trend is even more noticeable in the case of octanol\/water partition coefficients of alkanes.","36032":"Low-rank parity-check (LRPC) codes are rank-metric codes over finite fields, which have been proposed by Gaborit et al.\u00a0(Proceedings of the workshop on coding and cryptography WCC, vol 2013, 2013) for cryptographic applications. Inspired by a recent adaption of Gabidulin codes to certain finite rings by Kamche et al.\u00a0(IEEE Trans Inf Theory 65(12):7718\u20137735, 2019), we define and study LRPC codes over Galois rings\u2014a wide class of finite commutative rings. We give a decoding algorithm similar to Gaborit et al.\u2019s decoder, based on simple linear-algebraic operations. We derive an upper bound on the failure probability of the decoder, which is significantly more involved than in the case of finite fields. The bound depends only on the rank of an error, i.e., is independent of its free rank. Further, we analyze the complexity of the decoder. We obtain that there is a class of LRPC codes over a Galois ring that can decode roughly the same number of errors as a Gabidulin code with the same code parameters, but faster than the currently best decoder for Gabidulin codes. However, the price that one needs to pay is a small failure probability, which we can bound from above.","37754":"Sufficient data presence is one of the key preconditions for applying metrics in practice. Based on both Altmetric.com data and Mendeley data collected up to 2019, this paper presents a state-of-the-art analysis of the presence of 12 kinds of altmetric events for nearly 12.3 million Web of Science publications published between 2012 and 2018. Results show that even though an upward trend of data presence can be observed over time, except for Mendeley readers and Twitter mentions, the overall presence of most altmetric data is still low. The majority of altmetric events go to publications in the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, and Life and Earth Sciences. As to research topics, the level of attention received by research topics varies across altmetric data, and specific altmetric data show different preferences for research topics, on the basis of which a framework for identifying hot research topics is proposed and applied to detect research topics with higher levels of attention garnered on certain altmetric data source. Twitter mentions and policy document citations were selected as two examples to identify hot research topics of interest of Twitter users and policy-makers, respectively, shedding light on the potential of altmetric data in monitoring research trends of specific social attention.","39325":"Global optimization problems whose objective function is expensive to evaluate can be solved effectively by recursively fitting a surrogate function to function samples and minimizing an acquisition function to generate new samples. The acquisition step trades off between seeking for a new optimization vector where the surrogate is minimum (exploitation of the surrogate) and looking for regions of the feasible space that have not yet been visited and that may potentially contain better values of the objective function (exploration of the feasible space). This paper proposes a new global optimization algorithm that uses inverse distance weighting (IDW) and radial basis functions (RBF) to construct the acquisition function. Rather arbitrary constraints that are simple to evaluate can be easily taken into account. Compared to Bayesian optimization, the proposed algorithm, that we call GLIS (GLobal minimum using Inverse distance weighting and Surrogate radial basis functions), is competitive and computationally lighter, as we show in a set of benchmark global optimization and hyperparameter tuning problems. MATLAB and Python implementations of GLIS are available at \nhttp:\/\/cse.lab.imtlucca.it\/~bemporad\/glis\n\n.","46675":"With the fast growing economy, China has become the biggest automobile market in the world. Many Chinese families buy automobiles to promote individual wellbeing and facilitate the convenience of lives. Automobile purchase has become a general and important decision for a Chinese family. However, it is always difficult to make a decision on the automobile purchase that balance the automobiles performance and its cost. Moreover, the automobile maintenance market in China is monopolistic. Thus, the maintenance cost is a significant consideration in automobile purchase decision. This paper employs the concept of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure cost performance of the automobile with considering the monopoly maintenance cost. The RCA (ratio of the total price of accessories of an automobile to the price of the automobile) 100 index system is used to represent the maintenance cost of each automobile. The structure of the automobile maintenance market can be reflected with including the RCA 100 index system in the performance evaluation. Results of the case study of 28 automobiles in China verify the necessity of considering the maintenance cost in automobile purchase decision.","49500":"Detecting and segmenting salient objects from natural scenes, often referred to as salient object detection, has attracted great interest in computer vision.

We aim to provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in salient object detection and situate this field among other closely related areas such as generic scene segmentation, object proposal generation, and saliency for fixation prediction. Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii) datasets and evaluation metrics for salient object detection. We also discuss open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance, and suggest future research directions.","60482":"Humanoid robots have similar motion characteristics to humans and can be directly applied to human living space without modifying the existing environment. This characteristic makes the ability of humanoid robots to adapt to the human living environment better than non-humanoid robots such as wheeled robots. For example, it is difficult for wheeled robots to climb stairs, but humanoid robots can achieve this task through gait planning. For humanoid robots, it is important to maintain the stability of the humanoid robot while climbing stairs. Besides, the method of locating the position of the stairs is necessary. To realize the stair-climbing task of the humanoid robot, it is necessary to accurately locate the stair, plan the gait of the humanoid robot climbing stairs, and control the movement of the humanoid robot in real-time through the control system.

The first controller utilizes neighbors\u2019 measurements of the signal field and the second controller utilizes relative positions between neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed two controllers is proved by the stochastic averaging theory. The convergence speed of the source seeking system can be calculated for the first controller and it is proved that the convergence speed under the second controller is not slower than that under the first controller. In particular, the distributed controllers are effective for both connected and unconnected graph. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the controllers.","61279":"In this paper, the consensus problem is investigated for discrete-time multi-agent systems with additive process noises. Due to the presence of additive noises in the system dynamics, consensus cannot be achieved. The main contribution of this paper is to give the exact consensus error.

Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.","61280":"Analyzing the underlying characteristics of trade values movements has attracted much attention in the domestic research. However, the proposed understanding of these characteristics is limited by the intrinsic complexity of the imports\/exports. Since economic systems are naturally organized by hierarchies, a novel hierarchical model is proposed in this paper to forecast China\u2019s foreign trade. First, the foreign trade data are disaggregated from perspectives of trading partners and trading products, forming two independent hierarchical models with total exports and imports as target variables. Second, a bottom-up strategy is applied. All bottom time series are modelled by corresponding control variables according to trading theories. Forecasts for bottom time series are then combined to generate initial forecasts for total exports and imports. Finally, forecasts for total imports and exports from the two hierarchical models, plus a single VECM model are combined to generate final forecasts. Empirical experiments show that this proposed forecasting model approach significantly outperforms benchmark models and produces consistent forecasts for both total imports and exports or detailed items, which helps a lot for analyzing future trading structure evolution and making foreign trade policies.","61281":"This paper proposes three fractional discrete chaotic systems based on the Rulkov, Chang, and Zeraoulia-Sprott rational maps. The dynamics of the proposed maps are investigated by means of phase plots and bifurcations diagrams. Adaptive stabilization schemes are proposed for each of the three maps and the convergence of the states is established by using the Lyapunov method. Furthermore, a combination synchronization scheme is proposed whereby a combination of the fractional Rulkov and Chang maps is synchronized to the fractional Zeraoulia-Sprott map. Numerical results are used to confirm the findings of the paper.","61282":"In this paper, the event-triggered consensus for linear discrete-time multi-agent systems with parameter uncertainties is investigated. The parameter uncertainty is assumed to be norm-bounded. An event-triggered consensus protocol based on the predictive control method is proposed to make the multi-agent system achieve consensus. And for the design of the consensus protocol, the problem of estimating the control input is transformed into the problem of estimating state differences between agents. Furthermore, the event-triggered consensus protocol proposed in this paper only demands each agent to mornitor its state to determine its event-triggered instants. A sufficient existence condition for the consensus protocol is proposed based on the linear matrix inequality. And a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of the Zeno-like behaviour is also derived. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate that the event-triggered consensus protocol proposed in this paper can make the multi-agent system with parameter uncertainties achieve consensus effectively.","61283":"In this paper, the problems of robust stability and stabilization, for the first time, are studied for delayed fractional-order linear systems with convex polytopic uncertainties. The authors derive some sufficient conditions for the problems based on linear matrix inequality technique combined with fractional Razumikhin stability theorem. All the results are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically tractable. The proposed results are quite general and improve those given in the literature since many factors, such as discrete and distributed delays, convex polytopic uncertainties, global stability and stabilizability, are considered. Numerical examples and simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the effectiveness of our results.","61285":"This paper presents a robust estimation procedure by using modal regression for the partial functional linear regression, which combines the common linear model with the functional linear regression model. The outstanding merit of the new method is that it is robust against outliers or heavy-tail error distributions while performs no worse than the least-square-based estimation method for normal error cases. The slope function is fitted by B-spline. Under suitable conditions, the authors obtain the convergence rates and asymptotic normality of the estimators. Finally, simulation studies and a real data example are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. Both the simulation results and the real data analysis confirm that the newly proposed method works very well.","61287":"In this paper, a cooperative adaptive control of leader-following uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems is proposed. The communication network is weighted undirected graph with fixed topology. The uncertain nonlinear model for each agent is a higher-order integrator with unknown nonlinear functions, unknown disturbances and unknown input actuators. Meanwhile, the gains of input actuators are unknown nonlinear functions with unknown sign. Two most common behaviors of input actuators in practical applications are hysteresis and dead-zone. In this paper, backlash-like hysteresis and dead-zone are used to model the input actuators. Using universal approximation theorem proved for neural networks, the unknown nonlinear functions are tackled. The unknown weights of neural networks are derived by proposing appropriate adaptive laws. To cope with modeling errors and disturbances an adaptive robust structure is proposed. Considering Lyapunov synthesis approach not only all the adaptive laws are derived but also it is proved that the closed-loop network is cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (CSUUB). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to agents modeled with highly nonlinear mathematical equations and inverted pendulums. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method in dealing with both numerical and practical multi-agent systems.","61288":"In this paper, a cooperative region reconnaissance problem is investigated where a group of agents are required to fly across and detect events occur in an environment with static obstacles until an effective coverage is achieved. First, the region reconnaissance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. A coverage performance index with additional collision and obstacle avoidance constraints is given. Since the optimization index is an implicit function of state variables and cannot be used to compute gradients on state variables directly, an approximate optimization index is selected. Then, a non-convex optimization-based coverage algorithm is proposed to find the optimal reconnaissance location for each agent and guarantee no collisions trajectories among agents and obstacles. Finally, simulation experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","61289":"This paper considers the iterative sequential lasso (ISLasso) variable selection for generalized linear model with ultrahigh dimensional feature space.

Simulation study demonstrates that the new method is a desirable approach over other methods.","61291":"Based on the perspective of sustainability transitions (ST) theory, the paper dissects the opera-tional mechanisms of protected space driving emerging technology industrialization from an external system perspective, which is on the basis of defining essential characteristics and func-tional attributes of protected space. Meanwhile, it structures a three-dimensional evaluation model of protected space from the perspective of internal mechanism by introducing the policy mixes method. Finally, taking the Chinese New Energy Vehicle (NEV) industry as the example and using the system dynamics modeling method, the paper designs different simulation schemes from three dimensions of horizontal evolution trend, three types of policy instrument change and policy mixes of protected space, to predict and analyze the operation effect of protected space. The results show that the Chinese NEV industry is in the stage of market niche entry, and corresponding measures should be taken to increase the market scale, form effective demand and scale effect, and promote the diffusion of market niche; the effect of policy mixes is better than that of the single policy instrument; specific policy mixes should be adopted to develop simultaneously from both the supply and demand sides to improve the industrialization level of NEV.","61292":"This paper proposes a novel agent-based model combining private information diffusion to explain time-series momentum and reversal. Private information transmission allows heterogeneous trading strategies coexist in the artificial market.

The multi-agent systems consist of leader and agents, whose dynamics are second-order nonlinear. The objective is that the agents track the leader asymptotically with different time delays, i.e., the agents in different groups reach delay consensus, while the agents in the same group reach identical consensus. To guarantee the cluster-delay consensus for the second-order multi-agent systems, a new control protocol is proposed. Then some corresponding conditions for cluster-delay consensus are derived by using Lyapunov directed method and matrix theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis results are verified by some numerical simulations.","61294":"Since 2010, Chinese government has introduced a series of administrative policies to limit speculation in the housing market to stabilize price fluctuations and keep the housing market in a healthy state of development. In order to investigate whether administrative policy can play its due role, this paper constructs a comprehensive bottom-up housing market heterogeneous households multiagent model (HHMAM) to undertake research on the differentiated effect of administrative policy in different cities. The empirical studies find that: 1) Administrative policy that increases interest rates will cause housing prices to continue to decline in the long term, but they will resume a rising trend after reaching the lowest point; 2) If the government cancels a property-purchasing limitation, housing prices will continue to rise; and 3) investors tend to invest in 1st-tier cities due to the high demand and greater likelihood of appreciation in these cities.","61312":"In this study, we evaluate the effect on ion-trap quantum computers (QCs) from the quantum nature of the driving field, and propose a theoretical limit for ion-trap QCs that may impact the design of quantum algorithms and realization of practical QCs. We obtain, for the first time, the permitted depth of logical operation for fault-tolerant ion-trap QCs. Physically, we provide an exact (full-quantum) description of the QC system, and present for the first time its time evolution after gate operations; mathematically, we solve problems such as certain summations of trigonometric series with any given precision. Comparing the actual state after CNOT gates driven by a quantized field with the expected state, we obtain the failure probability and estimate that the number of CNOT gates on the same pair of physical qubits is not more than 102 in one error-correction period, which is a physical limit that cannot be easily overcome. The conclusion can help determine the number of CNOT operations between coding and decoding in one error-correction period and can be used as a reference for quantum algorithm design.","61313":"","61314":"","61315":"","61316":"","61317":"This paper considers the finite-time drive-response synchronization of stochastic nonlinear systems consisting of continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems.

However, as the application programming interfaces (APIs) of SDN are low-level or functionality-restricted, SDN programmers cannot easily keep pace with the ever-changing devices, topologies, and demands of SDN. By deriving motivation from industry practice, we define a novel network algorithm programming language (NAPL) that enhances the SDN framework with a rapid programming flow from topology-based network models to C++ implementations, thus bridging the gap between the limited capability of existing SDN APIs and the reality of practical network management. In contrast to several state-of-the-art languages, NAPL provides a range of critical high-level network programming features: (1) topology-based network modeling and visualization; (2) fast abstraction and expansion of network devices and constraints; (3) a declarative paradigm for the fast design of forwarding policies; (4) a built-in library for complex algorithm implementation; (5) full compatibility with C++ programming; and (6) user-friendly debugging support when compiling NAPL into highly readable C++ codes. The expressiveness and performance of NAPL are demonstrated in various industrial scenarios originating from practical network management.","61322":"To improve the robotic flexibility and dexterity in a human-robot collaboration task, it is important to adapt the robot impedance in a real-time manner to its partner\u2019s behavior.

As Cisco research reveals that virtualization of DC increases traffic within the DC and causes network bandwidth to become scarce resource, recent researches have been focusing on traffic-aware VM placement. However, previous traffic-aware VM placement schemes treat the VM placement as a static process in that they do not take into account the impact of the current placement decision on the subsequent placement. In this paper, we thus propose a novel online traffic-aware VM placement scheme. Our scheme views VM placement as a context-sensitive dynamic process in that the decision of every step of the placement is made aiming at helping the subsequent steps of placement to reduce the required network bandwidth in the long run. In our scheme, we consider not only inter-VM traffic but also the bandwidth constraint of a physical machine (PM) when making a VM placement decision. To realize our objective, we put those VMs with close end time in the same or close proximity PMs so that when the VMs are terminated, one can make enough room for the future arrivals so as to not only minimize the number of active PMs but also reduce networking costs. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the superiority of our scheme in terms of networking costs and energy consumption. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms improved-best-fit-decreasing (IBFD) scheme, a revised best-fit version that takes inter-VM traffic into account, by 30%\u201340% on network cost under various scenarios.

Various health problems related to AUD, such as cognitive deficits, have been linked to neuroinflammation. Alcohol use has been associated with changes in neuroimmune activity, although current literature has yielded mixed results. For example, markers of gliosis, including translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO), pro-inflammatory cytokines, glutamate (Glu), and myo-inositol (mI), are disrupted in the alcohol-dependent brain. Further, neuroinflammatory-related phenomena including membrane turnover, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and adenosine release have also shown alterations in AUD. However, current literature remains inconclusive about the directionality of these changes. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have provided insight on the relationship between alcohol use and neuroinflammatory processes, suggesting considerable treatment potential for alcohol use disorder and its inflammatory comorbidities.

Control primitives, such as manipulability optimization, trajectory tracking of the end-effector and mobile base, and collision avoidance, are considered in the framework and arranged at different priorities. Lower priority tasks are projected into the null space of control tasks with higher priorities. As a result, lower level tasks are completed without affecting the performance of higher priority tasks. Several experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Bariatric surgery (BS) is the only reliable treatment for morbid obesity. Unfortunately, it is unknown how BS affects neurocircuitry after weight loss. We aimed to examine effects of BS on the basal activity of brain areas involved in reward and motivation processing, emotion, memory, and gut-brain interaction. We combined resting-state fMRI with amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and Granger causality analysis (GCA) to assess interactions between regions within the frontal-mesolimbic circuitry in 16 obese subjects (OB) and 22 normal-weight (NW) subjects. The OB group was studied at baseline and 1 month post BS. Comparisons between OB and NW, and pre-and post BS showed significant differences in ALFF in areas involved in drive (caudate, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), arousal (thalamus), and conditioning\/memory (amygdala, hippocampus) (P < 0.05, FDR correction). GCA revealed that in the OB group, the OFC had greater connectivity to limbic regions (amygdala, hippocampus, and medial thalamus) and the caudate. Post BS, the connectivity of the OFC to limbic regions decreased, whereas the connectivity from the amygdala and hippocampus to the caudate and thalamus was enhanced, particularly in subjects with lower body mass index (BMI). OFC activation in the OB group was associated with BMI prior to surgery, and changes in OFC post surgery were associated with alterations in BMI. Overall, the functional connectivity of the OFC was significantly decreased. As it is important for salience attribution and connected to limbic brain regions involved with emotional reactivity and conditioning after BS, its significant association with BMI changes indicates the contribution of OFC changes to the improved control of eating behavior after surgery.","61337":"A multi-objective parametric design method that based on the robust observer is proposed for the attitude control of satellites with super flexible netted antennas. First, a parametric observer-based controller is obtained based on the eigen-structure assignment theory. The closed-loop poles are assigned to desired positions or regions, and full degrees of freedom of the design, which are characterized by a set of parameters, are preserved under the proposed control law. Second, the obtained parameters are comprehensively optimized to make the closed-loop system have lower eigenvalue sensitivity, a smaller control gain, and stronger tolerance to high-order unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out based on practical engineering parameters of a satellite in order to verify the effect of the proposed method, and also to show their superiority over the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with filters and the traditional dynamic compensators.","61338":"Wingbeat behavior and intermittent flight path are the two main characteristics of many birds.

High maneuverability swimming control of a bionic robotic fish has been one of the research hotspots in the robotic fish field. In this paper, an iterative learning method has been proposed to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of robotic fish swimming.

Recently, there are many studies on substance use disorders utilizing 1H-MRS to explore the mechanism of brain metabolites. It is found that metabolites levels in substance users are changed compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, these changes also relate to behavior indices, and provide evidence for the impact on neuronal health, energy metabolism and membrane turnover. However, 1H-MRS is not yet a mature detection technology, and it still has many challenges in the application of the neuropsychiatric disorder area. The settings of test parameters and the inconsistency of results across different studies still plague the clinicians and technicians. This article is intended to provide an overview of basic theory and methods of 1H-MRS, and the literature reporting metabolites alterations in substance dependence, as well as the related neuropsychological performance. At last, we will discuss the forthcoming challenges and possible future direction in this area.","61341":"Reconsolidation refers to memory reprocessing when consolidated memory is being recalled and restored. Importantly, as memory is being recalled, it could further modify past memories. Memory reconsolidation has been identified as a critical role in various types of mental disorders, in particular drug addiction. In this review, we first review earlier studies related to reconsolidation. Secondly, we characterize memory reconsolidation processing in human brain via neuroimaging studies. Then we focus on the role of reconsolidation and reconsolidation-based interventions in drug addiction. Finally, we highlight the potentials of combining reconsolidation-based interventions and neuroimaging techniques as a therapeutic tool in drug addiction.","61342":"We propose and numerically realize an optical spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) scheme by using a single vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). In the scheme, the VCSEL is subjected to an orthogonally-polarized continuous-wave optical injection (OPCWOI) and dual-polarized pulsed optical injections (DPPOI). Based on the widely used spin-flip model, the response spiking dynamics of VCSEL is numerically studied, and then the optical STDP in a single VCSEL is explored. The roles of bias current, the strength of OPCWOI and DPPOI, and the frequency detuning on the optical STDP curve are numerically analyzed. It is found that, by simultaneously utilizing the response spiking dynamics in two orthogonal polarization modes, an optical STDP could be achieved by using a single VCSEL. Furthermore, the weight update of STDP curve can be calculated in real-time. Additionally, the STDP curves can also be controlled by adjusting some controllable parameters. The real-time optical STDP based on a single VCSEL is numerically realized for the first time, which paves the way towards fully VCSELs-based photonic neuromorphic systems with low power consumption.","61343":"This paper proposes a notion of entity enhancing, which unifies entity resolution and conflict resolution, to identify tuples that refer to the same real-world entity and at the same time, correct semantic inconsistencies. We propose to unify rule-based and machine learning (ML) methods for entity enhancing, by embedding ML classifiers as predicates in logic rules. We model entity enhancing by extending the chase. We show that the chase warrants correctness justification and the Church-Rosser property. Moreover, we settle fundamental problems associated with entity enhancing, including the enhancing, consistency, satisfiability, and implication problems, ranging from NP-complete and coNP-complete to \u03a02-complete. Taken together, these provide a new theoretical framework for unifying entity resolution and conflict resolution.","61344":"The data center has developed rapidly over the past few years, leading to the demand for high speed data transmission. Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) based optical interconnect is evolving to 100 Gb\/s and beyond, which makes nonlinear distortions difficult to be compensated or equalized by conventional equalizers. Moreover, the challenge becomes very complicated for conventional equalizers because of the presence of inter-symbol interference (ISI) together with the nonlinear distortions. So many neural network based DSP algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN) have been proposed to mitigate the distortions. However, ANN has the limitations that sample\u2019s relevant information is not considered, leading to degradation in ANN\u2019s performance and high computational complexity. In this paper, in order to maintain an excellent capability of mitigating nonlinear distortions like other neural network based equalizers while considering the sample\u2019s relevant information to reduce the computational complexity, we propose a deep belief network-hidden Markov model (DBN-HMM) based nonlinear equalizer which is tested in a PAM-4 modulated VCSEL and multimode fiber (MMF) optical interconnect link experimentally. The BER performance can be greatly improved compared with conventional DSP algorithms. In addition, the computational complexity of DBN-HMM based equalizer can be about 41% lower than that of ANN based method with a similar BER performance.","61345":"The emerging intelligence technologies represented by deep learning have broadened their applications to various fields.

FSDNN and deep neural network (DNN) outperform the least mean square equalizer. Then, by splitting the received signal into two parallel signals using a digital low-pass filter and a high-pass filter, we demonstrate that the FSDNN significantly reduces the complexity of the traditional DNN post-equalizer. Moreover, the complexity of the FSDNN decreases considerably to 11.15% compared with the conventional DNN for a 2.7 Gbit\/s wide-band transmitted signal with a similar bit error ratio performance.","61350":"Traditionally, the operation and maintenance of optical networks rely on the experience of engineers to configure network parameters, involving command-line interface, middle-ware scripting, and troubleshooting. However, with the emerging of newly B5G applications, the traditional configuration cannot meet the requirement of real-time automatic configuration. Operators need a new configuration way without manual intervention at an underlying optical transport network. To cope with this issue, we propose an intent defined optical network (IDON) architecture toward artificial intelligence-based optical network automated operation and maintenance against service objective, by introducing a self-adapted generation and optimization (SAGO) policy in a customized manner. The IDON platform has three key innovations including intent-orient configuration translation, self-adapted generation and optimization policy, and close-loop intent guarantee operation. Focusing specifically on communication requirements, the IDON uses natural language processing to construct semantic graphs to understand, interact, and create the required network configuration. Then, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to find the composition policy that satisfies the requirement of intent through the dynamic integration of fine-grained policies. Finally, the deep neural evolutionary network (DNEN) is introduced to achieve the intent guarantee at the milliseconds level. The feasibility and efficiency are verified on enhanced SDN testbed. Finally, we discuss several related challenges and opportunities for unveiling a promising upcoming future of intent defined optical network.","61351":"In the optical networks, the dynamicity, the complexity and the heterogeneity have dramatically increased owing to the deployment of advanced coherent techniques, and the optical cross-connect technologies and diverse network infrastructures pose great challenges in the optical network management and maintenance for the network operators. In this review, we propose a \u201c3S\u201d architecture for AI-driven autonomous optical network, which can aid the optical networks operated in \u201cself-aware\u201d of network status, \u201cself-adaptive\u201d of network control, and \u201cself-managed\u201d of network operations. To support these functions, a number of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques have been investigated to improve the flexibility and the reliability from the device aspect to network aspect. Adaptative erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) controlling is an example for the device aspect, which provides a power self-adaptive capability according to the network condition. From the link aspect, adaptive fiber nonlinearity compensation, optical monitoring performance and quality of transmission estimation are developed to monitor and alleviate the link-dependent signal impairments in an automatic way. From the network aspect, traffic prediction and network state analysis methods provide the self-awareness, while automatic resource allocation and network fault management powered by AI enhance the self-adaptiveness and self-management capabilities. Benefit from the sufficient network management data, powerful data-mining capability and matured computation units, these AI techniques have great potentials to provide autonomous features for optical networks, including the network resource scheduling and the network customization.","61352":"The tapered asymmetric directional coupler has the potential to realize high fabrication tolerance and high transmission efficiency on-chip mode multiplexer. However, the geometry parameter selection of tapered structure remains empirical. In this paper, we propose a design method for the tapered structure based on genetic algorithm. Combined with the adjusted coupling equations and interpolation method, lowtime- cost optimization can be realized. Three mode multiplexers (TE0&TE1, TE0&TE2 and TE0&TE5) are designed by our method. According to simulation results, the insertion loss of the designed devices is lower than 1.8 dB and the crosstalk is lower than \u221215 dB when the fabrication error is within required range (\u00b110 nm for TE0&TE2 and TE0&TE5, and \u00b120 nm for TE0&TE1) in the bandwidth of 1.5\u20131.6 \u03bcm. In addition, the entire optimization process takes only 2 h for each device, which is around the time cost of a single 3D simulation.","61354":"Because software emerged, locating software faults has been intensively researched, culminating in various approaches and tools that have been applied in real development. Despite the success of these developments, improved tools are still demanded by programmers. Meanwhile, some programmers are reluctant to use any tools when locating faults in their development. The state-of-the-art situation can be naturally improved by learning how programmers locate faults. The rapid development of open-source software has accumulated many bug fixes. A bug fix is a specific type of comments containing a set of buggy files and their corresponding fixed files, which reveal how programmers repair bugs. Feasibly, an automatic model can learn fault locations from bug fixes, but prior attempts to achieve this vision have been prevented by various technical challenges. For example, most bug fixes are not compilable after checking out, which hinders analyzing bug fixes by most advanced static\/dynamic tools. This paper proposes an approach called ClaFa that trains a graph-based fault classifier from bug fixes. ClaFa is built on a recent partial-code tool called Grapa, which enables the analysis of partial programs by the complete code tool called WALA. Once Grapa has built a program dependency graph from a bug fix, ClaFa compares the graph from the buggy code with the graph from the fixed code, locates the buggy nodes, and extracts the various graph features of the buggy and clean nodes. Based on the extraction result, ClaFa trains a classifier that combines Adaboost and decision tree learning. The trained ClaFa can predict whether a node of a program dependency graph is buggy or clean. We evaluate ClaFa on thousands of buggy files collected from four open-source projects: Aries, Mahout, Derby, and Cassandra. The f-scores of ClaFa achieves are approximately 80% on all projects.","61355":"In this paper, a neuromorphic reservoir computing (RC) system with enhanced memory capacity (MC) based on a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) subject to double optical feedbacks (DOF) is proposed and investigated numerically. The aim of this study is to explore the MC of the proposed system. For the purpose of comparison, the MC of the VCSEL-based RC system with single optical feedback (SOF) is also taken into account. It is found that, compared with the VCSEL-based RC system subject to SOF, enhanced MC can be obtained for the VCSEL-based RC system with DOF. Besides, the effects of feedback strength, injected strength, frequency detuning as well as injection current on the MC of the VCSEL-based RC system with DOF are considered. Moreover, the influence of feedback delays is also carefully examined. Thus, such proposed VCSEL-based RC system with DOF provides a prospect for the further development of the neuromorphic photonic system based on RC.","61356":"Polarization control in nonlinear polarization rotation based mode-locked fiber lasers is a long-term challenge. Suffering from the polarization drifts induced by environmental disturbances, nonlinear polarization rotation based mode-locked fiber lasers is difficult in continuously operating under the desired pulsation regime thereby substantially hindering their utilizations. The appearance of automatic mode-locking techniques brings the light in addressing this challenge. Combining with various algorithms and electrical polarization control, automatic mode-locking techniques resolve the dilemma of nonlinear polarization rotation based mode-locked fiber lasers. We review the research progress of automatic mode-locking techniques in detail. Furthermore, we comment on the perspectives and potential applications of automatic mode-locking techniques.","61357":"Overfitting effect of artificial neural network (ANN) based nonlinear equalizer (NLE) leads to a trap of bit error ratio (BER) overestimation in optical fiber communication system, especially when the performance is evaluated by the commonly-used pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS). First, we mathematically investigate the PRBS generation and Gray code mapping rules, in comparison with the use of Mersenne Twister random sequence (MTRS). Under the condition of a symbol erasure channel, we identify that ANN can recognize both the PRBS generation and symbol mapping rules, by increasing the weights of NLE at specific positions, whereas the MTRS is currently safe owing to the limited input length of current ANN based NLE. Then, we design four channel models of fiber optical transmission to experimentally examine various impairments on the evolution of overfitting effect. When both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the bandwidth limited channel are considered, the mitigation of overfitting becomes possible by the use of pruned PRBS (P-PRBS) training set with removing the generation and mapping rules determined input symbols. However, as for both the chromatic dispersion (CD) uncompensated channel and the CD managed channel, the overfitting effect becomes serious, because both CD and fiber nonlinearity induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is beneficial for ANN to identify the PRBS symbol rules. Finally, possible solutions to mitigate the overfitting effect are summarized.","61358":"Photonic-based reservoir computing (RC) systems have attracted significant attention. Integrated and purely passive systems are compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices, but are limited by the lack of non-linear components. This study consists of two parts: firstly, a review on the published integrated and passive RC system is presented. The review focuses on the structural configuration (rather than the mathematical model) of the neural network; secondly, a new approach for achieving an integrated and passive photonic RC system is introduced and discussed. This approach employs a mode combiner in front of the reservoir to achieve an extra non-linearity in a purely passive device. Moreover, the approach is numerically investigated, and an XOR (exclusive or) task is used to test the device, and the result shows that the new approach satisfies the requirement of an RC system.","61359":"Over the past few decades, the demand for the capacity and reliability of optical networks has continued to grow. In the meantime, optical networks with larger knowledge scales have become sources of numerous heterogeneous data. In order to handle these new challenges, many issues need to be resolved, among which the low-margin optical networks design, power optimization, routing and wavelength assignment (RWA), failure management are quite important. However, the use of traditional algorithms in the above four applications shows some shortcomings. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), is regarded as one of the most promising methods to overcome these shortcomings. In this study, we review the applications of ML methods in solving these four issues.

The main challenge in this problem is to determine cross-view correspondences for the 2D joints in the presence of noise. We propose a 3D hypothesis clustering technique to solve this problem. The core idea is to transform joint matching in 2D space into a clustering problem in a 3D hypothesis space. In this way, evidence from photometric appearance, multiview geometry, and bone length can be integrated to solve the clustering problem efficiently and robustly. Each cluster encodes a set of matched 2D joints for the same person across different views, from which the 3D joints can be effectively inferred. We then assemble the inferred 3D joints to form full-body skeletons for all persons in a bottom\u2013up way. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach even in challenging cases with heavy occlusion, closely interacting people, and few cameras. We have evaluated our method on many datasets, and our results show that it has significantly lower estimation errors than many state-of-the-art methods.","61365":"Improper functioning, or lack, of human cone cells leads to vision defects, making it impossible for affected persons to distinguish certain colors. Colorblind persons have color perception, but their ability to capture color information differs from that of normal people: colorblind and normal people perceive the same image differently. It is necessary to devise solutions to help persons with color blindness understand images and distinguish different colors. Most research on this subject is aimed at adjusting insensitive colors, enabling colorblind persons to better capture color information, but ignores the attention paid by colorblind persons to the salient areas of images. The areas of the image seen as salient by normal people generally differ from those seen by the colorblind. To provide the same saliency for colorblind persons and normal people, we propose a saliency-based image correction algorithm for color blindness. Adjusted colors in the adjusted image are harmonious and realistic, and the method is practical. Our experimental results show that this method effectively improves images, enabling the colorblind to see the same salient areas as normal people.","61366":"In this paper, we consider salient instance segmentation. As well as producing bounding boxes, our network also outputs high-quality instance-level segments as initial selections to indicate the regions of interest. Taking into account the category-independent property of each target, we design a single stage salient instance segmentation framework, with a novel segmentation branch. Our new branch regards not only local context inside each detection window but also the surrounding context, enabling us to distinguish instances in the same scope even with partial occlusion. Our network is end-to-end trainable and is fast (running at 40 fps for images with resolution 320 \u00d7 320). We evaluate our approach on a publicly available benchmark and show that it outperforms alternative solutions. We also provide a thorough analysis of our design choices to help readers better understand the function of each part of our network.

To initiate the process, useful features of the given data need to be extracted first in a mature process where the standard LID features have been previously developed by employing the use of MFCC, SDC, GMM and the i-vector-based framework. Nevertheless, optimisation of the learning process is still required to enable a comprehensive capturing of the extracted features\u2019 embedded knowledge. The training of a single hidden layer neural network can be done using the extreme learning machine (ELM), which is an effective learning model for conducting classification and regression analysis. Nevertheless, the learning process of this model is not entirely effective (i.e. optimised) due to the random selection of weights within the input hidden layer.

Then, corresponding to the MCLF, the quasi-time-dependent switched filter is proposed for the considered switched system, and the sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the filtering error system is globally uniformly exponentially stable with a prescribed \n$$l_2-l_{\\infty }$$\n\n performance index.

When choosing an option, the decision maker not only considers the positions of the different alternatives into the ranking, but also usually checks the intensity values associated with them. Therefore, it is very important that methods used to build rankings adequately represent the preferences of users. These issues, known as order and intensity preservation conditions, have been studied for the well-known multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) called analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and extended to reconstruction methods of AHP matrices by defining a measure that considers only the order preservation condition. In this article, a measure, complementary to the latter, that allows establishing the difference between the predominance of the alternatives between two rankings is defined. To do this, the relations of predominance between the alternatives for each ranking are analyzed, and then the comparison between these relations is made by defining a bounded supremacy-based measure called supremacy difference index \n$$ sdi_{m} $$\n\n. The \n$$ sdi_{m} $$\n\n behavior is compared to conventional distance measures that are not bounded, and it is used to compare three reconstruction methods of AHP from the supremacy point of view and, finally, how the \n$$ sdi_{m} $$\n\n usage can be extended for the evaluation of any ranking-based method is discussed.","61371":"As an emerging technology, interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2 FLSs) have drawn great attentions in the past decade years. However, the computational intensive and time consuming type-reduction (TR) block may hinder the real applications IT2 FLSs. Unlike the most popular Karnik\u2013Mendel (KM) iterative algorithms, the noniterative algorithms decrease the computational cost greatly. The comparison between the discrete and continuous algorithms is still an open problem.

Then, three types of noniterative algorithms are adopted for performing the centroid TR of IT2 FLSs. Three computer simulations show the calculation results of sampling based discrete noniterative algorithms can accurately approximate the corresponding continuous noniterative algorithms as varying the number of sampling of primary variable appropriately, in addition, the computational efficiencies of former are much higher than the latter, which provide the potential value for designing IT2 FLSs.","61465":"This paper proposes keyword-citation-keyword (KCK) network to analyze the knowledge structure of a discipline.

In m-business providing LBS services, a client sends its exact locations to service providers. This data may involve sensitive and private personal information. Therefore, the misuse of location information by service providers creates privacy issues for clients. Moreover, the query must not be linked to the mobile client, even if the location information is exposed willingly by her\/him to obtain specific services. Thus, there are location cloaking algorithms that allow the protection of the location privacy of mobile users. Hence, many temporal and spatial approaches to cloaking a specific user\u2019s location have been proposed. Different from the existing methods, the current works define location and query privacy separately. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the issues related to the mobile client privacy. Mainly, we aim to preserve the client location privacy as well as the continuous queries privacy, where mobile clients continuously emit different queries during their travels. It\u2019s on this premise that we propose a new clique-based cloaking algorithm named Mobile Clique Cloak (MCC) to preserve the mobile client\u2019s privacy in the M-business providing LBS services. Also, to build the cloaking region in our approach, we take into account the similarity of client velocity and direction to obtain a right balance between quality of service QoS and privacy. Furthermore, we generate different realistic dummies instead of dropping the query; thus, all queries will be processed even in the case of k\u22121 other mobile clients\u2019 queries cannot be found. Moreover, our work deals with a series of attacks in the same cloaking process (location attack, tracking attack, query sampling attacks and homogenous attack). We evaluate our approach from three aspects: privacy guaranty, quality of service and performance. Experimental evaluation of our algorithms on a real world map shows that our approach ensures total privacy for clients and protects the privacy of clients during the entire query period whiles allowing clients\u2019 choice of privacy requirements. Besides, we compare our algorithm with existing privacy protection algorithms such as V-DCA, D-TC and GCA. According to the evaluation results and a comparison of the algorithms, our algorithm MCC can make a good balance between quality of service, performance and privacy.","62741":"In this paper, we identify issues and possible solutions in the key area of large-scale antenna systems, also know as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. Additionally, we propose the use of Massive MIMO technology as a means to tackle the uplink mixed-service communication problem. Under the assumption of an available physical narrowband shared channel (PNSCH), the capacity of the MTC network and, in turn, that of the whole system, can be increased by grouping Machine-Type Communication (MTC) devices into clusters and letting each cluster share the same time-frequency physical resource blocks. We study the feasibility of applying sub-optimal linear detection to the problem of detecting a large number of MTC devices sharing the same time-frequency resources at the uplink of a base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas, M. In our study, we derive the achievable lower-bound rates for the studied sub-optimal linear detectors and show that the transmitted power of each MTC device can be reduced as M increases, which is a very important result for power-constrained MTC devices running on batteries. Our simulation results suggest that, as M is made progressively larger, the performance of sub-optimal linear detection methods approach the matched filter bound, also known as perfect interference-cancellation bound.","63429":"Two research assessments with an impact on university funding have taken place in Italy, covering the periods 2004\u20132010 and 2011\u20132014. After correcting grading schemes in order to grant comparability across the two exercises, we show that university final scores exhibit some convergence. We find that convergence is largely due to changes in the relative productivity of researchers who participated to both exercises as well as to hiring and promotions occurred between the two exercises. Results are confirmed even when we equalise the number of products across the two exercises. When we consider departments within universities, we still find convergence, though the structure and composition of departments is not strictly comparable, because mapping researchers involves some arbitrariness. These results suggest that convergence reflect genuine changes in the behaviour of researchers and in the strategies of assessed institutions, induced by incentives created by the national research assessment exercises.","63430":"A continued growth in the volume of scientific literature may strain the practice of peer review possibly leading to delays in publication. While this appears true anecdotally, exact statistics are lacking. The study goal was to quantify delays in publication in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Eight orthopedic surgery journals with available publication dates between January 2010 and December 2015 were included. Main outcomes were (1) acceptance delay (time from submission to acceptance) and (2) publication delay (time from acceptance to publication). Temporal trends for both outcomes were assessed graphically while simple linear regression was applied to assess statistical significance. 12,811 manuscripts were included that released both acceptance and publication delays. From 2010 to 2015, the median overall acceptance delay decreased from 168 (interquartile range [IQR] 115\u2013225) to 113 (IQR 62\u2013176) days. Similarly, there was a decrease in publication delay from 55 (IQR 26\u201383) days in 2010 to 16 (IQR 9\u201354) days in 2015; both trends p\u2009<\u20090.0001. Per unit increase in impact factor, there was a 19.1% (95% CI 16.1, 22.2%) increase in acceptance delay and a 15.8% (95% CI 13.5, 17.9%) decrease in publication delay. In contrast to the hypothesis, there was a decrease in delays of the peer review process in the orthopaedic surgery literature. These data are encouraging in light of the timely availability of evidence to a wide audience.","63431":"Bulk-service multi-server queues with heterogeneous server capacity and thresholds are commonly seen in several situations such as passenger transport or package delivery services. In this paper, we develop a novel decomposition-based solution approach for such queues using arguments from renewal theory. We then obtain the distribution of the waiting time measure for multi-type server systems. We also obtain other useful performance measures such as utilization, expected throughput time, and expected queue lengths.","65684":"Computer-aided strategies are useful for reducing the costs and increasing the success-rate in drug discovery. Among these strategies, methods based on pharmacophores (an ensemble of electronic and steric features representing the target active site) are efficient to implement over large compound libraries. However, traditional pharmacophore-based methods require knowledge of active compounds or ligand\u2013receptor structures, and only few ones account for target flexibility. Here, we developed a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol, Flexi-pharma, that overcomes these limitations. The protocol uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore receptor flexibility, and performs a pharmacophore-based virtual screening over a set of MD conformations without requiring prior knowledge about known ligands or ligand\u2013receptor structures for building the pharmacophores. The results from the different receptor conformations are combined using a \u201cvoting\u201d approach, where a vote is given to each molecule that matches at least one pharmacophore from each MD conformation. Contrarily to other approaches that reduce the pharmacophore ensemble to some representative models and score according to the matching models or molecule conformers, the Flexi-pharma approach takes directly into account the receptor flexibility by scoring in regards to the receptor conformations. We tested the method over twenty systems, finding an enrichment of the dataset for 19 of them. Flexi-pharma is computationally efficient allowing for the screening of thousands of compounds in minutes on a single CPU core. Moreover, the ranking of molecules by vote is a general strategy that can be applied with any pharmacophore-filtering program.","65784":"In this article, we describe a new feature for exploring eye movement data based on image-based clustering. To reach this goal, visual attention is taken into account to compute a list of thumbnail images from the presented stimulus. These thumbnails carry information about visual scanning strategies, but showing them just in a space-filling and unordered fashion does not support the detection of patterns over space, time, or study participants. In this article, we present an enhancement of the EyeCloud approach that is based on standard word cloud layouts adapted to image thumbnails by exploiting image information to cluster and group the thumbnails that are visually attended.\nTo also indicate the temporal sequence of the thumbnails, we add color-coded links and further visual features to dig deeper in the visual attention data. The usefulness of the technique is illustrated by applying it to eye movement data from a formerly conducted eye tracking experiment investigating route finding tasks in public transport maps. Finally, we discuss limitations and scalability issues of the approach.","66204":"Compressed Sensing using \n              \n                \n              \n              $$\\ell _1$$\n              \n             regularization is among the most powerful and popular sparsification technique in many applications, but why has it not been used to obtain sparse deep learning model such as convolutional neural network (CNN)? This paper is aimed to provide an answer to this question and to show how to make it work.\nFollowing Xiao (J Mach Learn Res 11(Oct):2543\u20132596, 2010), We first demonstrate that the commonly used stochastic gradient decent and variants training algorithm is not an appropriate match with \n              \n                \n              \n              $$\\ell _1$$\n              \n             regularization and then replace it with a different training algorithm based on a regularized dual averaging (RDA) method. The RDA method of Xiao (J Mach Learn Res 11(Oct):2543\u20132596, 2010) was originally designed specifically for convex problem, but with new theoretical insight and algorithmic modifications (using proper initialization and adaptivity), we have made it an effective match with \n              \n                \n              \n              $$\\ell _1$$\n              \n             regularization to achieve a state-of-the-art sparsity for the highly non-convex CNN compared to other weight pruning methods without compromising accuracy (achieving 95% sparsity for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, for example).","66205":"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used to solve separable convex programming problems. At each iteration, the classical ADMM solves the subproblems exactly. For many problems arising from practical applications, it is usually impossible or too expensive to obtain the exact solution of a subproblem. To overcome this, a special proximal term is added to ease the solvability of a subproblem. In the literature, the proximal term can be relaxed to be indefinite while still with a convergence guarantee; this relaxation permits the adoption of larger step sizes to solve the subproblem, which particularly accelerates its performance. A large value of the relaxation factor introduced in the dual step of ADMM also plays a vital role in accelerating its performance. However, it is still not clear whether these two acceleration strategies can be used simultaneously with no restriction on the penalty parameter. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively and conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for indefinite proximal ADMM with a relaxation factor (IP-ADMM\n$$_{r}$$\n\n), reveal the relationships between the parameter in the indefinite proximal term and the relaxation factor to ensure its global convergence, and establish the worst-case convergence rate in the ergodic sense. Finally, some numerical results on basis pursuit and total variation-based denoising with box constraint problems are presented to verify the efficiency of IP-ADMM\n$$_{r}$$\n\n.","66206":"The exterior Bernoulli problem is rephrased into a shape optimization problem using a new type of objective function called the Dirichlet-data-gap cost function which measures the \n$$L^2$$\n\n-distance between the Dirichlet data of two state functions. The first-order shape derivative of the cost function is explicitly determined via the chain rule approach. Using the same technique, the second-order shape derivative of the cost function at the solution of the free boundary problem is also computed. The gradient and Hessian informations are then used to formulate an efficient second-order gradient-based descent algorithm to numerically solve the minimization problem. The feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated through various numerical examples.","66207":"In this paper we consider the classical unconstrained nonlinear multiobjective optimization problem. For such a problem, it is particularly interesting to compute as many points as possible in an effort to approximate the so-called Pareto front. Consequently, to solve the problem we define an \u201ca posteriori\u201d algorithm whose generic iterate is represented by a set of points rather than by a single one. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of a linesearch with extrapolation along steepest descent directions with respect to (possibly not all of) the objective functions. The sequence of sets of points produced by the algorithm defines a set of \u201clinked\u201d sequences of points. We show that each linked sequence admits at least one limit point (not necessarily distinct from those obtained by other sequences) and that every limit point is Pareto-stationary. We also report numerical results on a collection of multiobjective problems that show efficiency of the proposed approach over more classical ones.","66208":"This paper presents an approximation scheme for optimal control problems using finite-dimensional linear programs and interval analysis. This is done in two parts. Following Vinter approach (SIAM J Control Optim 31(2):518\u2013538, 1993) and using occupation measures, the optimal control problem is written into a linear programming problem of infinite-dimension (weak formulation). Thanks to Interval arithmetic, we provide a relaxation of this infinite-dimensional linear programming problem by a finite dimensional linear programming problem. A proof that the optimal value of the finite dimensional linear programming problem is a lower bound to the optimal value of the control problem is given. Moreover, according to the fineness of the discretization and the size of the chosen test function family, obtained optimal values of each finite dimensional linear programming problem form a sequence of lower bounds which converges to the optimal value of the initial optimal control problem. Examples will illustrate the principle of the methodology.","66210":"The problem of recovering acoustic sources, more specifically monopoles, from point-wise measurements of the corresponding acoustic pressure at a limited number of frequencies is addressed. To this purpose, a family of sparse optimization problems in measure space in combination with the Helmholtz equation on a bounded domain is considered. A weighted norm with unbounded weight near the observation points is incorporated into the formulation. Optimality conditions and conditions for recovery in the small noise case are discussed, which motivates concrete choices of the weight. The numerical realization is based on an accelerated conditional gradient method in measure space and a finite element discretization.","66211":"We consider a misspecified optimization problem, requiring the minimization of a function \n$$f(\\cdot;\\theta ^*)$$\n\n over a closed and convex set X where \n$$\\theta ^*$$\n\n is an unknown vector of parameters that may be learnt by a parallel learning process. Here, we develop coupled schemes that generate iterates \n$$(x_k,\\theta _k)$$\n\n as \n$$k \\rightarrow \\infty$$\n\n, then \n$$x_k \\rightarrow x^*$$\n\n, a minimizer of \n$$f(\\cdot;\\theta ^*)$$\n\n over X and \n$$\\theta _k \\rightarrow \\theta ^*$$\n\n. In the first part of the paper, we consider the solution of problems where f is either smooth or nonsmooth. In smooth strongly convex regimes, we demonstrate that such schemes still display a linear rate of convergence, albeit with larger constants. When strong convexity assumptions are weakened, it can be shown that the convergence in function value\u00a0sees a modification in the canonical convergence rate of \n$${{{\\mathcal {O}}}}(1\/K)$$\n\n by an additive factor proportional to \n$$\\Vert \\theta _0-\\theta ^*\\Vert$$\n\n where \n$$\\Vert \\theta _0-\\theta ^*\\Vert$$\n\n represents the initial misspecification in \n$$\\theta ^*$$\n\n. In addition, when the learning problem is assumed to be merely convex but admits a suitable weak-sharpness property, then the convergence rate deteriorates to \n$${\\mathcal {O}}(1\/\\sqrt{K})$$\n\n. In both convex and strongly convex regimes, diminishing steplength schemes are also provided and are less reliant on the knowledge of problem parameters. Finally, we present an averaging-based subgradient scheme that displays a rate of \n$${\\mathcal {O}}(1\/\\sqrt{K})+ \\mathcal{O}(\\|\\theta_0-\\theta^*\\|(1\/K))$$\n\n, implying no effect on the canonical rate of \n$${{{\\mathcal {O}}}}(1\/\\sqrt{K})$$\n\n. In the second part of the paper, we consider the solution of misspecified monotone variational inequality problems, motivated by the need to contend with more general equilibrium problems as well as the possibility of misspecification in the constraints. In this context, we first present a constant steplength misspecified extragradient scheme and prove its asymptotic convergence. This scheme is reliant on problem parameters (such as Lipschitz constants) and leads to a misspecified variant of iterative Tikhonov regularization, an avenue that does not necessitate the knowledge of such constants.","68856":"Pathogenesis of different diseases showed that some of them, especially thalassemia (T) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an implicit association with oxidative stress and altered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Introducing ROS level and the balance between ROS and antioxidants as essential metrics, an attempt was made to classify T and RA from normal individuals (treated as controls)(C) using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) and Raman line intensity of water. This non-invasive and label-free approach was backed up by a categorization algorithm that helped in the prediction of disease types from serum samples. The predictive system constituted principal component analysis (PCA) with four parameters, namely spectral intensity ratios of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to tryptophan (Trp) (NADH\/Trp), kynurenine (Kyn) to tryptophan (Kyn\/Trp), kynurenine to NADH (Kyn\/NADH), and logarithmic changes in Raman line intensity of water (Rline), with the index headers containing the disease types. Rline has a positive correlation with both Kyn\/Trp and Kyn\/NADH and a negative correlation with NADH\/Trp ratio, implying its direct or indirect association with oxidative stress. In addition to the classification of T, RA, and C a sub-classification of T into beta major and E-beta in their post and pre-splenectomized surgical stages could also be realized. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was deployed to ascertain that the misclassification error (ME) was negligible for the disease types.","69474":"","69475":"Selecting an enterprise architecture framework (EAF) that will best address the needs of their organization is a difficult task for enterprise architecture practitioners. The objective of this study is to make this difficult task easier. To do so, this research first conducts a review of the literature on EAF evaluation criteria. Findings from this review show the shortcomings of this literature, most importantly the lack of a comprehensive set of EAF criteria and adequate measures for their operationalization. Based on these findings, and using the design science research approach, this study then designs and tests an EAF evaluation artifact that identifies, elaborates and operationalizes a comprehensive set of 14 criteria. Results of the experiment that followed show that: (i) 90.87% of the criteria were perceived usable, (ii) 97.62% of them were perceived to be applicable and relevant, and (iii) 90.48% were perceived as correct. This study makes several contributions. First, it provides a much-needed and timely overview of the literature on EAF evaluation criteria. Second, this study is the first to present a comprehensive set of criteria that not only synthesizes previously proposed criteria but also includes new criteria (e.g., SOA models and usability). Third, it answers EA practitioners\u2019 requests for a tool that is both theoretically sound and practical. Finally, and most importantly, this study is the first to propose objective measures to operationalize EAF evaluation criteria.","73142":"With the emergence of numerical sensors in many aspects of everyday life, there is an increasing need in analyzing multivariate functional data. This work focuses on the clustering of such functional data, in order to ease their modeling and understanding. To this end, a novel clustering technique for multivariate functional data is presented. This method is based on a functional latent mixture model which fits the data into group-specific functional subspaces through a multivariate functional principal component analysis. A family of parsimonious models is obtained by constraining model parameters within and between groups. An Expectation Maximization algorithm is proposed for model inference and the choice of hyper-parameters is addressed through model selection. Numerical experiments on simulated datasets highlight the good performance of the proposed methodology compared to existing works. This algorithm is then applied to the analysis of the pollution in French cities for 1 year.","73143":"We introduce three dominance criteria to compare the performance of alternative value at risk (VaR) forecasting models. The three criteria use the information provided by a battery of VaR validation tests based on the frequency and size of exceedances, offering the possibility of efficiently summarizing a large amount of statistical information. They do not require the use of any loss function defined on the difference between VaR forecasts and observed returns, and two of the criteria are not conditioned by the choice of a particular significance level for the VaR tests. We use them to explore the potential for 1-day ahead VaR forecasting of some recently proposed asymmetric probability distributions for return innovations, as well as to compare the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (APARCH) and the family of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (FGARCH) volatility specifications with more standard alternatives. Using 19 assets of different nature, the three criteria lead to similar conclusions, suggesting that the unbounded Johnson SU, the skewed Student-t and the skewed Generalized-t distributions seem to produce the best VaR forecasts. The unbounded Johnson SU distribution performs remarkably well, while symmetric distributions seem clearly inappropriate for VaR forecasting. The added flexibility of a free power parameter in the conditional volatility in the APARCH and FGARCH models leads to a better fit to return data, but it does not improve upon the VaR forecasts provided by GARCH and GJR-GARCH volatilities.","74126":"China has greatly increased the number of published works indexed in the Web of Science since 1980. This corpus of scholarship allows analysis of the creativity or innovation of that contribution, where creativity is indicated by deep conventionality and high novelty. A test is applied to analyze reference pairs in articles to search for unexpected referencing combinations at the journal\u2013journal level. The method has shown that atypical reference pairs occur in more highly cited articles. Using articles with at least one Chinese address as indexed in Web of Science for the publication year 2007, we tagged articles based on the conventionality and novelty of the reference pairs, seeking, in particular, those articles that reveal atypicality. This atypical set of articles represented 8% of all Chinese articles, compared to the world level of 7% in 2005. China\u2019s atypical work is also more highly cited than a similar set of records at the world level for the years 1980\u20132000. The findings suggest that China has advanced in its goals of establishing itself as a full participant in global science and technology.","74127":"The paper investigates the reference corpus of a climate change contrarian report. We categorized the journal abstracts according to the endorsement positions on anthropogenic climate change. These results were contrasted by an in-text citation analysis. We focused here on the role of the papers included by the report editors concerning the mainstream claims around climate change. Our results showed moderate differences in the endorsement rates as well as in the sources of contrarian arguments considering the contrarian report in general and the presented journals specifically. These outcomes indicate differences among the journals regarding editorial practice, topic-dependency, and the home field advantage of some authors. Beyond the bibliometric data, our additional rhetorical analysis showed that language and wording are at least as important as the references backing the claims. The well-founded atmosphere of doubt in the climate skeptic report relies on two prevalent factors working together: relevant information accumulated on methodological uncertainties and findings that do not support mainstream knowledge claims (1); and solemn rhetoric supplemented with proper re-contextualization and reinterpretation (2).","74128":"This study investigates how the alliance partners\u2019 ego-network advantages, measured by the betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and degree, affect focal firms\u2019 ego-network advantages, innovation performance and the alliance stability. Under the exploitative innovation paradigm, alliance partners holding greater ego-network advantages would significantly improve focal firms\u2019 ego-network advantages; Clustering coefficient and degree of alliance partners\u2019 ego-network significantly improves focal firms\u2019 innovation performance; However, they generate significant but mixing effect on the alliance stability. As innovation becomes more exploitation oriented, all of these effects weaken. Alliance partners\u2019 ego-networks generate relatively weaker indirect effects on the focal firms as that of their own ego-networks. This suggests that the indirect network effects are not negligible. Our study suggests that alliance partners play a rather periphery role under exploratory innovation paradigm compared with that under the exploitative innovation paradigm. This is because the former requires more indigenous efforts to make breakthrough inventions. The results based on the counterfactual simulation process focus on the effect of key alliance partners\u2019 ego-networks and reach generally similar conclusions, which confirms the robustness of this study. We discuss these findings and formulate policy implications at the end of this study.","74129":"Due to its quantitative nature, bibliometrics is becoming increasingly popular among policy makers for academic hiring and career promotions. In this article, we quantitatively assess the impact that the granularity level in the classification of scientific areas would entail on research evaluation based on bibliometric indicators. We use as a case study the Italian national habilitation system (ASN), which classifies faculty members according to their academic discipline and relies on journal counts, citations, and h-indices as a basis for promoting tenure track researchers to associate professors and associate to full professors. The assessment checks whether the individual indicators of a researcher are above a certain threshold, e.g., the median over the population of researchers working in the same discipline. Our investigation focuses on two related, rather broad disciplines: computer science and computer engineering. We show that the ASN practice of using the same thresholds for all members of a scientific discipline can favor certain sub-communities that are characterized by higher bibliometric indicators, and disfavor others. We report evidence that up to 30% of Italian faculty members of certain sub-communities would see their indicators drop below the threshold, thus becoming not eligible for promotion, if the ASN were conducted on a more accurate, fine-grained classification. Conversely, in the same scenario, up to 11% of faculty members, in different sub-communities, would see their indicators rise above the threshold, granting them eligibility. Our data set includes 1685 authors, 89,185 distinct publications, and 262,286 author-publication pairs.","74130":"Examining coauthorship networks is key to study scientific collaboration patterns and structural characteristics of scientific communities. Here, we studied coauthorship networks of sociologists in Italy, using temporal and multi-level quantitative analysis. By looking at publications indexed in Scopus, we detected research communities among Italian sociologists. We found that Italian sociologists are fractured in many disconnected groups. The giant connected component could be split into five main groups with a mix of three main disciplinary topics: sociology of culture and communication (present in two groups), economic sociology (present in three groups) and general sociology (present in three groups). By applying an exponential random graph model, we found that collaboration ties are mainly driven by the research interests of these groups. Other factors, such as preferential attachment, gender and affiliation homophily are also important, but the effect of gender fades away once other factors are controlled for. Our research shows the advantages of multi-level and temporal network analysis in revealing the complexity of scientific collaboration patterns.","74132":"Self-citation is attracting wide attention in citation analysis research and research evaluation practice. However, the academic community\u2019s views on self-citation are not uniform. If the number of self-citations should be calculated, it is critical to calculate it accurately and unambiguously. However, based on a case study of thirty papers published during 2014 and 2020 by the corresponding author of the study, we find that the numbers of self-citations identified through the automatic identification tools provided by Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection are confusing and inconsistent. We also put forward corresponding improvement suggestions to the stakeholders including these two authoritative bibliographic database providers at the end of this article.","74133":"The existing literature on innovation ecosystem overlooks the differences between knowledge ecosystems and business ecosystems, and mostly focuses on a single-layer analysis of the ecosystem. Also, ecosystem mapping studies involve either whole-network analysis at the macro-level or ego-network analysis at the micro-level, while few studies have investigated network community analysis at the meso-level. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework of Multi-layered Innovation Ecosystem Mapping (MIEM) to explore both knowledge and business ecosystems, thereby extending the analysis to the network communities. Based on multi-source heterogeneous data and machine learning, MIEM includes four steps in conducting the analysis: define the research scope and collect data; construct whole networks; identify communities; and recognize strategic roles. In particular, Newman topological clustering is adopted to identify network communities, and a strategic-role matrix is used to analyze the roles in a community. Based on this framework, a case study of numerical-control machine tool ecosystem mapping is conducted using patents and value-added tax invoice data.","74135":"Research on the determinants of scholarly productivity is flourishing, driven both by long-standing curiosity about its wide variation, and by recent concern over race and gender inequalities. Beyond standard structural and demographic determinants of research output, some studies point to the role of individual psychology. We contribute to scholarship on personality and productivity by showing not only that personality matters, but when and for whom. Using an original, representative study of faculty from one discipline, political science, we propose and test several hypotheses about the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality determinants of productivity, as gauged through counts of publications, H-index scores, and citations. Controlling for a large number of familiar determinants (e.g., race, gender, rank, and institutional incentives), we find that conscientiousness predicts productivity, but that its effects are conditioned by openness to experience. More precisely, we discover that these two personality traits have compensatory effects, such that openness to experience and conscientiousness each matter most in the absence of the other. In addition, personality has heterogeneous impacts on productivity across different contexts; conscientiousness more strongly affects scholarly output in research-oriented institutions, while collaboration reduces the penalty associated with lack of conscientiousness.","74136":"Studies around public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) have shaped a complex and colorful research field. A series of review studies have been performed to explore the knowledge base of this field. Despite their significant contributions, bibliometric research on the PPPs literature is still needed to capture more comprehensive, diverse and detailed information in this area from a holistic perspective, for reducing subjectivity and one-sidedness. Under this situation, this paper continues the bibliometric journey by conducting a comprehensive metrological and content analysis of the PPPs research field. By applying a newly developed Bibliometrix R-package tool, the overview of PPPs research is presented via metrological analysis using a series of indexes. The intellectual structure of this domain is then explored via content analysis using the methods of keywords analysis and citation analysis from both static and dynamic perspectives. Consequently, the panoramic view including the overview, pivotal points of topics, thematic evolution and research focuses of this domain are depicted visually and intuitively via a set of science maps. This new attempt crystallizes out key findings and valuable information of PPPs research, which can consolidate and broaden the bibliometric findings of previous PPPs literature studies and act as a guidance for analyzing the knowledge base of other research fields.","75368":"Advertising as a direct marketing activity as well as word-of-mouth (WOM) as an indirect marketing activity are widely accepted as the most influential determinants of new product performance. Although electronic WOM (eWOM), as a type of WOM, has recently been studied extensively in various industries, previous results appear mixed due to their characteristics such as volume and valence. To bridge the gap regarding the roles of advertising and eWOM in the movie diffusion process, they were classified into pre-eWOM\/advertising and post-eWOM\/advertising based on two stages of the diffusion process. To reflect the heterogeneity of consumption characteristics on a new product, consumers were divided into two groups\u2014innovators and imitators. This study proposed a model to investigate the role of advertising and eWOM in the movie diffusion process. In addition, the proposed model was used to analyze the impact of firm-initiated advertising and user-generated online reviews on movie performance in Korea.","75369":"A real valued function f defined on a real open interval I is called \n$$\\Phi $$\n\n-monotone if, for all \n$$x,y\\in I$$\n\n with \n$$x\\le y$$\n\n it satisfies \n$$\\begin{aligned} f(x)\\le f(y)+\\Phi (y-x), \\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere \n$$ \\Phi :[0,\\ell (I) [ \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}_+$$\n\n is a given nonnegative error function, where \n$$\\ell (I)$$\n\n denotes the length of the interval I.

We also introduce a generalization of the classical notion of total variation and we prove an extension of the Jordan Decomposition Theorem known for functions of bounded total variations.","75371":"For B2C (Business to Customer) commerce platforms, quickly attracting enough consumers is an extremely important issue. However, existing studies mainly analyze whether consumers make online purchase and its influencing factors, but pay less attention to the changes in consumer size. Therefore, this paper aims to study the changing law of consumer quantity from the macro level, which may help E-commerce platforms reasonably predict it. Firstly, we point out the unique feature of the B2C commerce platforms compared with traditional products or technologies, namely indirect network externality. And we combine this feature and the factors that influence consumers and enterprises\u2019 adoption of B2C commerce to build an extended Bass Model. Finally, we verify the validity of our model with the data of Chinese online shoppers. In addition, we put forward some suggestions on the future research of this extended Bass Model.","76873":"This paper presents a Broadcast and Reliable Coverage based Efficient Recursive Routing (BRCER) in Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks for Event-Driven Applications with Mobile Sinks (MSs). For data routing in the network, the proposed protocol updates the connectivity list by using local broadcast and multicast announcement. Instead of broadcasting in the whole network, the local broadcasting is used to save sensor node energy which maximizes the battery lifetime of sensors. However, the multicast announcement provides the appropriate path whenever the event activities are performed by MSs. In addition, reliable communication connectivity among sensor nodes, which depends on the surrounding and the deployment of sensor nodes, is also our prime concern for better quality of service (QoS). The main focus of BRCER protocol is to timely route the data with proper load distribution in the network with reliable connectivity. Theoretical concept and simulation results further validate that BRCER protocol can withstand in worse environmental conditions with effective network performance.","76874":"This paper aims to propose an efficient numerical method for the most challenging problem known as the robust Euclidean embedding (REE) in the family of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). The problem is notoriously known to be nonsmooth, nonconvex and its objective is non-Lipschitzian. We first explain that the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations and Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) approach, popular for other types of problems in the MDS family, failed to provide a viable method for this problem. We then propose a penalized REE (PREE), which can be economically majorized. We show that the majorized problem is convex provided that the penalty parameter is above certain threshold. Moreover, it has a closed-form solution, resulting in an efficient algorithm dubbed as PREEEDM (for Penalized REE via EDM optimization). We prove among others that PREEEDM converges to a stationary point of PREE, which is also an approximate critical point of REE. Finally, the efficiency of PREEEDM is compared with several state-of-the-art methods including SDP and EDM solvers on a large number of test problems from sensor network localization and molecular conformation.","77761":"Differential evolution (DE) is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm that has been proved powerful in solving a wide range of real-parameter optimization tasks. However, the selection of the mutation strategy and control parameters in DE is problem dependent, and inappropriate specification of them will lead to poor performance of the algorithm such as slow convergence and early stagnation in a local optimum. This paper proposes a new method termed as Joint Adaptation of Parameters in DE (JAPDE). The key idea lies in dynamically updating the selection probabilities for a complete set of pairs of parameter generating functions based on feedback information acquired during the search by DE. Further, for mutation strategy adaptation, the Rank-Based Adaptation (RAM) method is utilized to facilitate the learning of multiple probability distributions, each of which corresponds to an interval of fitness ranks of individuals in the population. The coupling of RAM with JAPDE results in the new RAM-JAPDE algorithm that enables simultaneous adaptation of the selection probabilities for pairs of control parameters and mutation strategies in DE. The merit of RAM-JAPDE has been evaluated on the benchmark test suit proposed in CEC2014 in comparison to many well-known DE algorithms. The results of experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAM-JAPDE algorithm outperforms or is competitive to the other related DE variants that perform mutation strategy and control parameter adaptation, respectively.","81964":"A logic \n$$\\mathbf{L}$$\n\n is called self-extensional if it allows to replace occurrences of a formula by occurrences of an \n$$\\mathbf{L}$$\n\n-equivalent one in the context of claims about logical consequence and logical validity. It is known that no three-valued paraconsistent logic which has an implication can be self-extensional. In this paper we show that in contrast, the famous Dunn\u2013Belnap four-valued logic has (up to the choice of the primitive connectives) exactly one self-extensional four-valued extension which has an implication. We also investigate the main properties of this logic, determine the expressive power of its language (in the four-valued context), and provide a cut-free Gentzen-type proof system for it.","84926":"Planner surfaces play an important role in several mapping and planning applications in urban areas. Automated algorithms to extract such surfaces are essential since they reduce the time and cost when compared to editing these DEMs manually. These surfaces could be constructed from either correlation-based DEMs or LIDAR point clouds. The advantages of the first over the second make it more appealing in generating 3D planer surfaces. In this paper we outline an automated algorithm to delineate 3D surfaces in DEMs compiled from a set of high resolution digital aerial photographs. Each cell in the DEM is assigned three attributes representing: height from bare ground, local statistics of neighboring elevations, and homogeneity of pixel intensities in corresponding aerial photos. These attributes are used to classify DEM points to ground and non-ground points using a feedforward back-propagation neural network. Candidate non-ground points are further segmented into different surfaces based on their tendency to lie in a plane. The 3D parameters of roof planes are then estimated using a robust estimator and regression analyses. DEM points contiguous to the roof patches are augmented if they pass an intensity compatibility check. Results showed an average increase in the precision of the DEMs\u2019 heights for roof posts from 48\u00a0cm to 15\u00a0cm.","85090":"In this paper, we have proposed a smart building health monitoring system to avoid unwanted mishaps. Some accidents take place with no warning. The work in this paper presents an internet of things (IoT) based building health monitoring (BHM) system. The system comprises Piezoelectric sensors, Arduino and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. Piezoelectric sensor (PZT) is used to generate and receive Lamb waves and the received wave is further analyzed to determine the health of the concrete structure. The approach is unique and uses cloud and mobile app-based monitoring. There are two important features of the suggested system; it monitors the damage in concrete structure and uploads the data to the cloud server. The exclusive technique takes the help of cloud sever system for its favorable position of data usability, ease of access and disaster recuperation. This proposed system generates all details associated with structural health of a specific building and can inform to the responsible authority for corrective measures. So that it can avoid mishaps and save lives, money, and properties.","85091":"The nature of human\/instrument interaction is a long-standing area of study, drawing interest from fields as diverse as philosophy, cognitive sciences, anthropology, human\u2013computer-interaction, and artistic creation. In particular, the case of the interaction between performer and musical instrument provides an enticing framework for studying the instrumental dynamics that allow for embodiment, skill acquisition and virtuosity with (electro-)acoustical instruments, and questioning how such notions may be transferred into the realm of digital music technologies and virtual instruments. This paper offers a study of concepts and technologies allowing for instrumental dynamics with Digital Musical Instruments, through an analysis of haptic-audio creation centred on (a) theoretical and conceptual frameworks, (b) technological components\u2014namely physical modelling techniques for the design of virtual mechanical systems and force-feedback technologies allowing mechanical coupling with them, and (c) a corpus of artistic works based on this approach. Through this retrospective, we argue that artistic works created in this field over the last 20 years\u2014and those yet to come\u2014may be of significant importance to the haptics community as new objects that question physicality, tangibility, and creativity from a fresh and rather singular angle. Following which, we discuss the convergence of efforts in this field, challenges still ahead, and the possible emergence of a new transdisciplinary community focused on multisensory digital art forms.","87909":"In this work, we address the problem of providing job recommendations in an online session setting, in which we do not have full user histories. We propose a recommendation approach, which uses different autoencoder architectures to encode sessions from the job domain. The inferred latent session representations are then used in a k-nearest neighbor manner to recommend jobs within a session. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, (1) a proprietary dataset we gathered from the Austrian student job portal Studo Jobs, (2) a dataset released by XING after the RecSys 2017 Challenge and (3) anonymized job applications released by CareerBuilder in 2012. Our results show that autoencoders provide relevant job recommendations as well as maintain a high coverage and, at the same time, can outperform state-of-the-art session-based recommendation techniques in terms of system-based and session-based novelty.","87910":"Time synchronization is an essential characteristic for the faithful functioning of wireless sensor networks. Hypothetically, it is stated that the two clocks are considered to be synchronized with each other if their clock offset and frequency components within the oscillator are running at the same rate. But, practically, there is some degree of inaccuracy in the manufacturing of these clocks; as a result, their frequency sources have slight variations. This paper proposes a unique mathematical model which is based on maximum probable theory maximum probable clock offset estimation, along with the propagation delay factor for finding the best probable estimate for clock offset. In addition, a novel two-way message passing scheme-based network communication model is presented here. Based on results, it has been predicted that estimating the clock offset will help in improving the efficiency of the existing time-synchronization protocols i.e. time-sync protocol for sensor networks (TPSNs). It was observed that the standard error deviation of modified TPSN with MPCEO was reduced from 2.324 to 0.064\u00a0ms. This will make the modified TPSN model more accurate, efficient, and reliable.","87975":"Plant recognition is a meaningful research that has attracted many researchers. Due to the variety of plants, it is difficult for the existing identification methods to identify their species efficiently. We proposes a plant recognition method based on Jaccard distance and Bag of words (BOW). Firstly, Jaccard distance is employed to calculate the similarity between the test sample and part of the training samples of all species, \n$$C_{1}$$\n\n species with the highest similarity are selected as candidate species of the test image, which not only reduce the amount of computation but also shorten the time consumption. Secondly, BOW is employed to extract features from texture image and contour image, and support vector machine is used for training and classification. In our method, the texture and contour features of leaf images are extracted by Laws texture measure and Sobel operators respectively. The local and global features of the leaf can be described well. Some representative datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method and obtain high accuracy. Comparison with existing methods proves that the proposed method not only has a high accuracy, but also has robustness in noise environment.","87976":"In this paper, we propose a novel visual object tracking method using a part based appearance model. First, a local kernel feature is developed to encode edge information of patches. Next, bounding box of the target is divided into multiple parts. Then, each part uses correlation filter based tracking to predict position in the next frame. The matrix cosine similarity is utilized to measure reliabilities of the patches. Finally, optimal target location is predicted via maximizing the likelihood, which is obtained by adaptively fusing the reliable patches locations. Experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art tracking methods significantly in terms of accuracy and robustness.","87977":"Nowadays, with the development of social media networks, micro-videos, an emerging form of user-generated contents (UGCs), are gradually attracting greater interest. Some of them are widely spread, while others draw little attention. The popular micro-videos have significant commercial potential in many ways, such as online advertising and bandwidth allocation. In recent years, the popularity prediction of long videos, web images and texts have gained abundant theoretical support and made great practical success. However, little research has been conducted on micro-videos. There are three difficulties in dealing with the problem: (1) micro-videos are short in duration; (2) the quality of micro-videos is relatively poor; (3) micro-videos can be described by multiple heterogeneous features involving social, visual, acoustic and textual modalities. For these purposes, we presented a feature-discrimination transductive model (FDTM). The proposed method regards the multi-view features as two properties: the low-level features and the attribute features. We divided the micro-videos into different levels of popularity via the attribute features and predicted the popularity scores via the low-level features precisely. Moreover, in the process of prediction, we sought a latent common feature subspace, where the micro-videos can be comprehensively represented. The latent subspace can aggregate the multiple low-level feature information to alleviate the problem of information insufficiency. Extensive experiments on a public dataset show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements compared with the best-known models.","87978":"Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important branch of human-centered research. Advances in wearable and unobtrusive technologies offer many opportunities for HAR. While much progress has been made in HAR using wearable technology, it still remains a challenging task using unobtrusive (non-wearable) sensors. This paper investigates detection and tracking of multi-occupant HAR in a smart-home environment, using a novel low-resolution Thermal Vision Sensor (TVS). Specifically, the research presents the development and implementation of a two-step framework, consisting of a Computer Vision-based method to detect and track multiple occupants combined with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based HAR. The proposed algorithm uses frame difference over consecutive frames for occupant detection, a set of morphological operations to refine identified objects, and features are extracted before applying a Kalman filter for tracking. Laterally, a 19-layer CNN architecture is used for HAR and afterward the results from both methods are fused using time interval-based sliding window. This approach is evaluated through a series of experiments based on benchmark Thermal Infrared datasets (VOT-TIR2016) and multi-occupant data collected from TVS. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of detecting and tracking 88.46% of multi-occupants with a classification accuracy of 90.99% for HAR.","87979":"Crowd congestion-level analysis (CCA) is one of the most important tasks of crowd analysis and helps to control crowd disasters. The existing state-of-the-art approaches either utilize spatial features or spatial\u2013temporal texture features to implement the CCA. The state-of-the-art deep-learning approaches utilize a single column convolution neural network (CNN) to extract deep spatial features to solve the objective function and perform better than traditional approaches. But still, the performance is needed to be improved as these models can not capture features invariant to perspective change. The proposed work is mainly based on two intuitions. First, both deep spatial and temporal features are required to improve the performance of the model. Second, a multi-column CNN with different kernel size is capable of capturing features invariant to perspective and scene change. Based on these intuitions, we proposed a two-input stream multi-column multi-stage CNN with parallel end to end training to solve the CCA. Each stream extracts spatial and temporal features from the scene, followed by a fusion layer to enhance the discrimination power of the model. We demonstrated experiments by using publicly available datasets such as PETS-2009, UCSD, UMN. We manually annotated 22\u00a0K frames into one of five crowd congestion levels such as Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High. The proposed model achieves accuracies of 96.97%, 97.21%, 98.52%, 98.55%, 97.01% on PETS-2009, UCSD-Ped1, UCSD-Ped2, UMN-Plaza1 and UMN-Plaza2, respectively. The model processes nearly 30 test frames per second and hence applicable in real-time applications. The proposed model outperforms some of the existing state-of-the-art techniques.","87980":"This research aims to assist users to seek information efficiently while interacting with speech-based information, particularly in multimedia delivery, and reports on an experiment that tested two speech-based designs for communicating multiple speech-based information streams efficiently. In this experiment, a high-rate playback design and a concurrent playback design are investigated. In the high-rate playback design, two speech-based information streams were communicated by doubling the normal playback-rate, and in the concurrent playback design, two speech-based information streams were played concurrently. Comprehension of content in both the designs was also compared with the benchmark set from regular baseline condition. The results showed that the users\u2019 comprehension regarding the main information dropped significantly in the high-rate playback and the concurrent playback designs compared to the baseline condition. However, in answering the questions set from the detailed information, the comprehension was not significantly different in all three designs. It is expected that such equeryfficient communication methods may increase productivity by providing information efficiently while interacting with an interactive multimedia system.","87981":"Thermal sensors bring a lot of benefits for object tracking due to the robustness to lighting changes over time, which still give a great difficulty to traditional tracking methods. Despite this powerful advantage, the ambiguity due to background clutters and occlusions makes the problem of thermal sensor-based tracking intractable. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multiple object tracking in livestock breeding spaces using a single thermal sensor. The key idea of the proposed method is to define a new rotatable elliptical motion model, which is suitable for describing complicated motions of animals. Moreover, the proposed local constraint guides our tracker to robustly chase targets even with severe occlusions. Experimental results on various thermal video sequences show the significant improvement for tracking animals compared to other approaches proposed in the literature.","87988":"Recognition of micro-expressions depends on the key features provided in the form of the temporal information. It needs considerable effort, however, to manually design useful characteristics. Subtle or micro-facial expressions are much difficult than regular facial expressions rich in emotional expressions in a true environment to be identified. An easy solution is discussed in this paper to recognise facial micro-expressions that utilizes an algorithm mix for facial identification, feature extraction and classification. The technique proposed is a framework which incorporates handcrafted features and deep features. Local Binary Pattern-Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) is the handcraft feature which combines spatial and time analysis to encapsulate regional facet movements. The deep feature model is a micro-expression fine-tuned model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Two classifiers, i.e. SVM and Softmax are trained with combined feature vectors produced by LBP-TOP and CNN functionalities. All seven widely-used micro-expression databases are evaluated in an experiment. Our research can be claimed as the first extensive experimental study on a big amount of the datasets to train and test the suggested model. The findings in the document show that the method proposed, although simple and straightforward, achieves a substantial increase in precision relative to other commonly recognized micro-expression techniques, which are trained and tested with just a few datasets.","90426":"The wrist and finger extensors play a crucial role in the muscle coordination during grasping tasks. Nevertheless, few data are available regarding their force-generating capacities. The objective of this study was to provide a model of the force-length-activation relationships of the hand extensors using non-invasive methods. The extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) were studied as representative of wrist and finger extensors. Ten participants performed isometric extension force-varying contractions in different postures on an ergometer recording resultant moment. The joint angle, the myotendinous junction displacement and activation were synchronously tracked using motion capture, ultrasound and electromyography. Muscle force was estimated via a musculoskeletal model using the measured joint angle and moment. The force-length-activation relationship was then obtained by fitting a force-length model at different activation levels to the measured data. The obtained relationships agreed with previously reported data regarding muscle architecture, sarcomere length and activation-dependent shift of optimal length. Muscle forces estimated from kinematics and electromyography using the force-length-activation relationships were comparable, below 15% differences, to those estimated from moment via the musculoskeletal model. The obtained quantitative data provides a new insight into the different muscle mechanics of finger and wrist extensors.","90450":"This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised segmentation and labeling of acoustically homogeneous segments from the speech signals. The virtual labels, thus obtained, are used to build unsupervised acoustic models in the absence of manual transcriptions. We refer to this approach as unsupervised speech signal-to-symbol transformation. This approach mainly involves three steps: (i) segmenting the speech signal into acoustically homogeneous regions, (ii) assigning consistent labels to the acoustic segments with similar characteristics and (iii) iterative modeling of the acoustic segments sharing the same label. This work focuses on improving initial segmentation and acoustic segment labeling. A new kernel-Gram matrix-based approach is proposed for segmentation. The number of segments is automatically determined using this approach, and performance comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms is achieved. The segment labeling is formulated in a graph clustering framework. Graph clustering methods require extensive computational resources for large datasets. A new graph growing-based strategy is proposed to make the algorithm scalable. A two-stage iterative modeling is used to refine the segment boundaries and segment labels alternately. The proposed method achieves highest normalized mutual information and purity on TIMIT dataset. Quality assessment of the virtual labels is performed by building a language identification (LID) system for Indian languages. A bigram language model is built using these virtual phones. The LID system built using these virtual labels and corresponding language model performs very close to the system trained using manual labels and an i-vector-based LID system. The fusion of unsupervised LID system scores from our approach and the i-vector approach outperforms the LID system built under the supervision of manual labels by a relative margin of 31.19% demonstrating the effectiveness of unsupervised LID systems that can be at par with supervised systems by using virtual labels.","90451":"In this paper, we employ the geometry of uniform circular array to achieve classification and localization of mixed near-field and far-field sources. Considering that the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix requires high computational cost, we develop the propagator method to obtain the noise subspace and reduce complexity. Firstly, since the direction parameters of far-field sources at centrosymmetry sensors hold a conjugate structure while the covariance matrix of near-field sources holds a Hermitian structure, we exploit the covariance differencing approach to extract the pure near-field sources from mixed sources. Then, we improve the ESPRIT-like method and one-dimensional MUSIC method to determine the 2-D direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range of near-field sources, respectively. Finally, by calculating the noise power of mixed sources, we utilize the oblique projection approach to extract the pure far-field sources and exploit the 2-D MUSIC method to determine the 2-D DOA of far-field sources. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can avoid the pseudo-peaks in the 2-D DOA spatial spectrum of far-field sources and provide the satisfactory performance of mixed source localization.","90452":"In multi-processor system-on-chips, on-chip interconnection plays a significant role. The type of on-chip architecture being used in an application decides the performance of that application. Hence, a quick and versatile network-on-Chip (NoC) simulator, particularly for the larger designs, is essential to explore and find the best suitable NoC configuration for individual applications. An FPGA-based NoC simulation framework has been proposed in this work. The crossbar switch of the NoC router with buffers and five ports has been embedded in the wide multiplexers of the DSP48E1 slices. The distinctive feature of dynamic mode functionality of the DSP48E1 slices every clock cycle depending on the control signals of multiplexer plays a crucial role in incorporating the crossbar functionality. A substantial decrease in the configurable logic blocks (CLBs) utilization of NoC topologies on the FPGA has been observed by embedding the functionality of the crossbar on the DSP48E1 slices. Since there is a reduction in the use of CLB resources employing the crossbar based on DSP48E1, topologies of larger sizes can be simulated. \n$$6\\times 6$$\n\n Mesh topology with the DSP crossbar implementation consumes 36% fewer lookup tables (LUTs) and 40% fewer flip flops than the Mesh topology with CLB-based crossbar implementation. 41% fewer LUTs and 23% fewer slices are consumed by the proposed work with respect to the state-of-the-art CONNECT NoC generation tool. Compared to DART, a reduction of 86% and 80% in LUTs and slices has been observed with respect to the proposed work. Hoplite-DSP implements the unidirectional Torus topology with no buffers considering the deflective routing algorithm. The proposed work targets Mesh-based topologies with buffers and bidirectional ports with XY and look-ahead routing algorithms.","90453":"A methodology for designing anti-windup compensators is investigated, for sampled-data systems with delays and actuator saturation. More precisely, criteria for the existence of an anti-windup compensator that ensure simultaneously stability and an \n$$H_{\\infty }$$\n\n norm bound in closed-loop are developed, thanks to the use of a three-term approximation of the delays, of the scaled small gain theorem, and of a Wirtinger-based inequality. The criteria are in the form of a set of linear matrix inequalities: an optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the estimated domain of attraction that can be easily implemented. Some simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.","90923":"Given the rapid rate at which text data are being digitally gathered in the medical domain, there is growing need for automated tools that can analyze clinical notes and classify their sentences in electronic health records (EHRs). This study uses EHR texts to detect patients\u2019 disease history from clinical sentences. However, in EHRs, sentences are less topic-focused and shorter than that in general domain, which leads to the sparsity of co-occurrence patterns and the lack of semantic features. To tackle this challenge, current approaches for clinical sentence classification are dependent on external information to improve classification performance. However, this is implausible owing to a lack of universal medical dictionaries. This study proposes the ETM (enrichment by topic modeling) algorithm, based on latent Dirichlet allocation, to smoothen the semantic representations of short sentences. The ETM enriches text representation by incorporating probability distributions generated by an unsupervised algorithm into it. It considers the length of the original texts to enhance representation by using an internal knowledge acquisition procedure. When it comes to clinical predictive modeling, interpretability improves the acceptance of the model. Thus, for clinical sentence classification, the ETM approach employs an initial TFiDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) representation, where we use the support vector machine and neural network algorithms for the classification task. We conducted three sets of experiments on a data set consisting of clinical cardiovascular notes from the Netherlands to test the sentence classification performance of the proposed method in comparison with prevalent approaches. The results show that the proposed ETM approach outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.","90925":"Community question answering (cQA) has emerged as a popular service on the web; users can use it to ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer (QA) pairs. cQA retrieval, as an alternative to general web searches, has several advantages. First, user can register a query in the form of natural language sentences instead of a set of keywords; thus, they can present the required information more clearly and comprehensively. Second, the system returns several possible answers instead of a long list of ranked documents, thereby enhancing the efficient location of the desired answers. Question retrieval from a cQA archive, an essential function of cQA retrieval services, aims to retrieve historical QA pairs relevant to the query question. In this study, combined queries (combined inverted and nextword indexes) are proposed for question retrieval in cQA. The method performance is investigated for two different scenarios: (a) when only questions from QA pairs are used as documents, and (b) when QA pairs are used as documents. In the proposed method, combined indexes are first created for both queries and documents; then, different information retrieval (IR) models are used to retrieve relevant questions from the cQA archive. Evaluation is performed on a public Yahoo! Answers dataset; the results thereby obtained show that using combined queries for all three IR models (vector space model, Okapi model, and language model) improves performance in terms of the retrieval precision and ranking effectiveness. Notably, by using combined indexes when both QA pairs are used as documents, the retrieval and ranking effectiveness of these cQA retrieval models increases significantly.","90926":"Depression, a common mental disorder, affects not only individuals but also families and society. In the beginning stage, most of the depressive people do not know they are suffering from depression. Some of them visit different medical departments to ask for help. However, their symptoms may not be relieved because of not having a proper diagnosis. In this paper, we find discriminatory features for establishing an early depression detection model by analyzing medical data. These features are composed of patients\u2019 medical information, including diagnosed diseases and medical departments. We use real-world electronic health records dataset from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the analysis and focus on young people aged 10-24 years. The experiment results show that our model can detect future diagnosis of depression based on patients\u2019 records up to 90 days in advance. Furthermore, even better performance can be achieved with longer observation time.","91283":"When resolving many-objective problems, multi-objective optimization algorithms encounter several difficulties degrading their performances. These difficulties may concern the exponential execution time, the effectiveness of the mutation and recombination operators or finding the tradeoff between diversity and convergence. In this paper, the issue of 3D redeploying in indoor the connected objects (or nodes) in the Internet of Things collection networks (formerly known as wireless sensor nodes) is investigated. The aim is to determine the ideal locations of the objects to be added to enhance an initial deployment while satisfying antagonist objectives and constraints. In this regard, a first proposed contribution aim to introduce an hybrid model that includes many-objective optimization algorithms relying on decomposition (MOEA\/D, MOEA\/DD) and reference points (Two_Arch2, NSGA-III) while using two strategies for introducing the preferences (PI-EMO-PC) and the dimensionality reduction (MVU-PCA). This hybridization aims to combine the algorithms advantages for resolving the many-objective issues. The second contribution concerns prototyping and deploying real connected objects which allows assessing the performance of the proposed hybrid scheme on a real world environment. The obtained experimental and numerical results show the efficiency of the suggested hybridization scheme against the original algorithms.","91284":"The speed by which the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world caught some national and local governments unprepared. Healthcare systems found themselves struggling to increase capacity and procure key supplies, such as personal protective equipment. Protective face shields became essential for healthcare professionals. However, most hospitals and healthcare facilities did not have them in adequate quantities. The urgency of producing and delivering face shields increased as the number of COVID-19 cases rapidly multiplied. This was the situation that we encountered in the city and province of Burgos (Spain). Since there was no time to wait for a large manufacturer to produce face shields, private citizens and small companies volunteered to make them using technologies such as 3D printers. Nonprofits, citizens, and governments agencies volunteered to deliver materials to the face shield makers and to pick up and deliver the face shields to health centers and other locations where they were needed. This resulted in a vehicle routing problem with some special characteristics that made it different from models used for commercial purposes. We describe the development of a heuristic to find feasible and efficient routes for this problem. We highlight the advantages of using heuristics in an emergency context like the one triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the heuristic approach allowed us to design, implement, test, and delivery a routing system in less than 1\u00a0week from the time that the local government contacted us with what they described as a logistics nightmare.","91944":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have conquered comprehensive survey progressions in the regular control and management fields. Although WSN allows the spatial monitoring of real-world events, the mobility action depletes a huge part of a sensor\u2019s energy cost in wireless communication. WSN sensors are often prone to various faults as frequent crashes and temporary or permanent failures. This is because it propagates them in very complex and harsh environments. So, we tend to design a Self-Adaptive based Autonomous Fault-Awareness (SAAFA) model, to limit the impact of such failures and filter them. In this paper, we incorporate the two of adaptive-filters FIR with RLS through three adaptive two-stages performed at the level of cluster head, for independent fault-correction during the propagation platform. The proposed model (SAAFA) included two stages, the first stage comprised self-detection the failure and self-aware for the lost scales, in which relied on responses of delay port and prior-knowledge of absent sensor-signals throughout monitoring, through adjusting the filter weights in the adaptive feedback loop for awarding convergent signals for the lost ones. The second stage is adaptive filtering the registered signals from the above stage for gaining pure measures and free of interferences. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the scheduled model attained a speed in diagnosing faults and awareness the missing readings with a rate of accuracy reached 98.8% improving the robustness of performance. Evaluation criteria revealed the progress of SAAFA in reducing the radio communication to\u2009~\u200997.47% that kept about 93.7% of battery-energy throughout the picked dataset sample. Hence, it expanded the whole network lifetime.","91946":"In periodic data-gathering, sensors can switch on the transceiver only during packet transmission to save energy. Exact clock-synchronization is challenging to achieve because of error present in synchronization protocols. Clock-disagreement increases with time in the absence of synchronization. This paper proposes an Energy-efficient Multi Beacon Guard method (EMBG) to decrease the energy consumption by minimizing the awake time of sender and receiver by periodically switching on and off the receivers during the guard-time. We determine the optimal number-of-times the receiver needs to wake up along with the wake-up intervals to collectively minimize the total energy consumption of the sender\u2013receiver pair during transmission. This paper shows the effectiveness of EMBG in energy conservation and compares with existing approaches using ns2 simulation.","91951":"In this paper, we consider an energy harvesting device-to-device (D2D) communication system, where D2D transmitter can use mode A to directly communicate with D2D receiver or use mode B as a relay to assist cellular communication while communicating with D2D receiver by adopting non-orthogonal multiple access technology. Firstly, the outage probability expression in two modes is derived, and the communication mode is determined according to outage performance. Then, assuming that the full system information is available, the channel allocation and relay selection are completed by Kuhn\u2013Munkres algorithm, and the offline power allocation of D2D users is realized by reinforcement learning. Next, the offline optimization results are taken as the training data set to train the neural network, and the optimal model of the transmission power is obtained. Considering the transmission power constraint, the online power allocation optimization algorithm is further proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of derived outage probability, and the proposed resource allocation algorithm can improve the performance of hybrid system.","91952":"Big-data acquisition and processing is important in developing value driven machine learning applications. This is challenging in compute resource-constrained scenarios. Compute resource-constrained scenarios arise due to low capacity of installed cloud infrastructure and low availability of high speed internet links. These factors limit the ability to process crowd-sourced data to develop machine learning applications. The volunteer computing paradigm is found to be suitable for addressing these challenges. Volunteer computing paradigm makes use of computing nodes provided by users distributed over a geographical area. It leverages on the availability of volunteers with low cost computing entities. This paper proposes the fractionated computing system (FCS) to address the challenges described above. FCS incorporates intelligent compute node selection and uses high performance end-user computing nodes (laptops) to process the crowd-sourced data. The performance of FCS is investigated against the existing method of using cloud servers. Results show that FCS reduces acquisition costs and power consumption by 35% and up to 56.5% on average, respectively. The watt per bit expended in processing crowd-sourced data is also enhanced by up to 98% on average. In addition, the use of FCS enhances memory resources accessible for data processing. Simulations show that increasing memory in modular computing entities by up to 58.7% enhances memory available across network of modular volunteer computing nodes by 0.5\u00a0EB. The use of end-user nodes with modular communication subsystems instead of end-user computing nodes with non-modular communication sub-systems enhances channel capacity by 37.5% on average.","91953":"Deep learning (DL) has been recognized as an instrumental tool for the design of future communication systems. Since it is still not clear whether a fully data-driven end-to-end communication learning approach would eventually outperform the traditional ones in terms of performance and complexity, it is argued that the optimal design needs to be tackled by taking the benefits of both model-based and data-driven approaches and by leveraging the concept of transfer learning. However, the grand question lies in how this can be implemented efficiently. As such, this paper proposes an efficient end-to-end OFDM based receiver learning approach based on distributed data-driven and model-based approaches. The approach relies mainly on augmenting a typical OFDM receiver\u2019s processing blocks with a shallow neural network as a data-driven stub to improve its performance. Relying on a two-phases training approach, the last receiver\u2019s processing stage benefits from the transfer learning approach to improve its performance.\nLimiting the scope to a typical OFDM transmission where the DL-based methods fail, the proposed model-aided shallow learning receiver shows performance improvements compared to the baseline structure.","91954":"Early prediction of a forest fire is one of the critical research challenges of the wireless sensor network (WSN) to save our ecosystem. In WSN based forest fire detection system, sensor nodes are deployed in the remote forest area for transmitting the sensed data to the base station, which is accessible by the forest department. Though sensor nodes in the forest are localized through GPS connection, the high deployment cost for it motivates the authors of this paper to design a novel localization technique applying the Support Vector Machine. Forest fire prediction in an energy efficient way is another concern of this paper. The semi-supervised classification model is proposed to address this problem by dividing the forest area into different zones [High Active (HA), Medium Active (MA), and Low Active (LA)]. It is designed in such a way that it can be able to predict the state of the (HA, MA, LA) fire zone with 90% accuracy when only one parameter is sensed by sensor nodes due to energy constraints. The greedy forwarding technique is used to transmit the packets from the HA zone to the base station continuously, and the MA zone transmits packets periodically, whereas, LA zone avoids transmitting the sensed data to the base station. This technique of data forwarding enhances network lifetime and reduces congestion during data transmission from the forest area to the base station.","91955":"This paper investigates a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique by employing device-to-device (D2D) transmission in small-cell networks. More specifically, the D2D transmission combines the relay selection model from a group of macro base stations (MBS) with the D2D mode in in small-cell network to form a D2D-NOMA system. Such D2D transmission needs assistance from multiple MBS and the small-cell base station (SBS) using decode-and-forward (DF) techniques. In this context, full-duplex (FD) is adopted at intermediate nodes. Furthermore, there are two possible scenarios in practice including perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI that need to be studied to examine performance degradation in such considered network. To evaluate system performance, we derive expressions of outage probability for D2D user. Our study results show that the proposed network with more MBSs selection can improve the outage performance compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Finally, numerical results confirms the accuracy of the derived expressions.","91957":"This paper presents a broadband Bowtie antenna with metamaterial periodical structure for broadband wireless systems and emerging 5G communication frequency band. The modified Bowtie antenna operating from 4 to 6.8 GHz with electrically coupled split-ring resonator (ECSRR) unit cells are proposed and analyzed. In two element Bowtie antenna, the third tuning arms are included to improve matching in the proposed operating frequency band. Four different shaped electrically coupled split-ring resonator (triangle, elliptical, hexagon and pentagon) with negative permeability and negative permittivity metamaterial unit cells are proposed and their reflection properties are analyzed. The triangle shaped ECSRR have the broadband reflection phase property which can be used to enhance the gain of the Bowtie antenna. The 5 \n$$\\times$$\n\n 6 periodical ECSRR unit cell embedded with modified Bowtie antenna in FR4 epoxy substrate (\n$$\\epsilon _r$$\n\n = 4.4, thickness = 1.6\u00a0mm, tan \n$$\\delta$$\n\n = 0.025) was designed and fabricated. The presented Bowtie antenna design achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 50% from 4 to 6.8\u00a0GHz (S11 \n$$\\le$$\n\n\n$$-$$\n\n\u00a010\u00a0dB) and maximum gain of 5.75 dBi.

To this end, it is desirable to minimize the time needed for data aggregation. This paper investigates the minimum-latency aggregation scheduling problem in wireless sensor networks. We propose an aggregation tree construction algorithm called Break-and-Join which adjusts any aggregation tree toward a smaller delay one. In order to perform tree adjustments, the algorithm iteratively changes parent of some nodes in the tree, using a novel numerical metric as a tree quality guideline. Each node determines if it can adopt an additional child in the neighborhood in order to relax the aggregation load at some bottleneck node in the network, thereby improving the overall aggregation tree quality. We performed the algorithm on several state-of-the-art aggregation schemes, and the results shows that final aggregation delay is quite indifferent to choice of initial tree and the tree quality can be significantly improved (e.g. 7 times for shortest path tree). Scheduling on the obtained trees also outperforms the best known scheme up to 13% in terms of delay.","92129":"Online reviews are broadly believed to reflect consumers\u2019 opinions towards the reviewed items. In this work, we postulate that online reviews for experience goods also reflect something very different, the reviewer\u2019s emotions while experiencing the item. We study the case of films, which are made with the intent of evoking an emotional response. We postulate that the emotions that the viewer experienced while watching the movie are reflected in their online review, and can be reliably extracted from it. We aggregate these emotional experiences to create an emotional signature for the film\u2014the emotions that it tends to evoke in viewers. We conduct a series of validations, each designed to offer evidence that the emotional signature indeed reflects the emotions that the film evokes in viewers. Our results demonstrate that experience goods\u2019 online reviews can be utilized for extracting and understanding users\u2019 emotional experience. Items\u2019 induced emotions can be used in affective recommender systems and affective multimedia retrieval. In addition, users\u2019 ability to easily see in advance the emotions that the item has induced in others, is relevant for research on the effect of expected emotions on decision-making.","92638":"In this paper, a novel zig-zag scan-based feedback convolution algorithm for image encryption against differential attacks is proposed. The two measures Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changed Intensity (UACI) are commonly utilized for analyzing the differential attacks. From the study of the existing papers, even though high Number of Pixel Change Rate and Unified Average Changed Intensity values are obtained, a few values lie in the critical range of \u03b1-level significance which in turn increase the possibility of differential attacks. To overcome differential attacks, two aspects of scanning with different test cases are analyzed and from these analyses, it is concluded that zig-zag scan based feedback convolution in forward and reverse direction achieves good Number of Pixel Change Rate and Unified Average Changed Intensity without critical values. Zig-zag scan based feedback convolution in forward and reverse direction is enforced for key sequence generation and applied in diffusion process to achieve high level of security. Moreover, plain image related initial seed is also generated to overcome the chosen\/known plain text attacks. Both numerical and theoretical analyses are performed to prove that the proposed encryption method is resistant to differential attacks. General security measures are carried out for the proposed method to validate its security level. From the simulations, it is shown that the proposed methodology has good keyspace, high key sensitivity, good randomness, and uniform distribution of cipher image pixels.","92639":"In this paper, we propose an efficient frequent-pattern-based outlier detection method, namely, UWFP-Outlier, for identifying the implicit outliers from uncertain weighted data streams. For reducing the time cost of the UWFP-Outlier method, in the weighted frequent pattern mining phase, we introduce the concepts of the maximal weight and maximal probability to form a compact anti-monotonic property, thereby reducing the scale of potential extensible patterns. For accurately detecting the outliers, in the outlier detection phase, we design two deviation indices to measure the deviation degree of each transaction in the uncertain weighted data streams by considering more factors that may influence its deviation degree; then, the transactions which have large deviation degrees are judged as outliers. The experimental results indicate that the proposed UWFP-Outlier method can accurately detect the outliers from uncertain weighted data streams with a lower time cost.","92640":"Knowledge base completion has been an active research topic for knowledge graph. However, existing methods are of low learning and generalization abilities, and neglect the rich internal logic between entities and relationships. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the modeling of complex internal logic for knowledge base completion. This method first integrates the semantic information into the knowledge representation model and strengthens the credibility scores of the positive and negative triples with the semantic gap, which not only makes the model converge faster, but also can obtain the knowledge representation of the fusion semantic information; and then we put forward the concept of knowledge subgraph, through the memory network and multi-hop attention mechanism, the knowledge information in the knowledge subgraph and the to-be-complemented triple are merged. In the process of model training, we have different training methods from the classical memory network, and added reinforcement learning. The reciprocal of the correct reasoning knowledge information in the model output is used as the reward value, and the final training model complements the triple information. The high computing capability of knowledge representation, the high learning and generalization abilities of the memory network and the multi-hop attention mechanism are also utilized in the method. The experimental results on data sets FB15k and WN18 show that the present method performs well in knowledge base completion and can effectively improve Hits@10 and MRR values. We also verified the practicability of the proposed method in the recommendation system and question answering system base on knowledge base, and have achieved good results.","92641":"Most existing deep-learning-based fall detection methods use either 2D neural network without considering movement representation sequences, or whole sequences instead of only those in the fall period. These characteristics result in inaccurate extraction of human action features and failure to detect falls due to background interferences or activity representation beyond the fall period. To alleviate these problems, a skeleton-based 3D consecutive-low-pooling neural network (S3D-CNN) for fall detection is proposed in this paper. In the S3D-CNN, an activity feature clustering selector is designed to extract the skeleton representation in depth videos using pose estimation algorithm and form optimized skeleton sequence of fall period. A 3D consecutive-low-pooling (3D-CLP) neural network is proposed to process these representation sequences by improving network in terms of layer number, pooling kernel size, and single input frame number. The proposed method is evaluated on public and self-collected datasets respectively, outperforming the existing methods.","92642":"This paper investigates the use of recurrent neural network to predict urban long-term traffic flows. A representation of the long-term flows with related weather and contextual information is first introduced. A recurrent neural network approach, named RNN-LF, is then proposed to predict the long-term of flows from multiple data sources. Moreover, a parallel implementation on GPU of the proposed solution is developed (GRNN-LF), which allows to boost the performance of RNN-LF. Several experiments have been carried out on real traffic flow including a small city (Odense, Denmark) and a very big city (Beijing). The results reveal that the sequential version (RNN-LF) is capable of dealing effectively with traffic of small cities. They also confirm the scalability of GRNN-LF compared to the most competitive GPU-based software tools when dealing with big traffic flow such as Beijing urban data.","92643":"The graduation development such as employment and graduate school admission of college students are important tasks. However, mining the factors that can affect the development of graduation remains challenging, because the most important factor \u201ccourse\u201d is not independent and inequality, which are always ignored by previous researchers. Furthermore, traditional structured methods cannot handle the complex relationships between courses, and attention networks cannot distinguish the weights of compulsory and elective courses with different distributions. Therefore, we present a Graph-based Hierarchical Attention Neural Network Model with Elective Course (GHANN-EC) for the prediction of graduation development in this study. Specifically, we use graph embedding that captures the unstructured relationships between courses and hierarchical attention that assigns the importance of the courses to excavating course information that represent students\u2019 independent interests, and can more accurately understand the relationship between graduation development and academic performance. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show that GHANN-EC outperforms the existing popular approach.","92644":"Hyperspectral (HS) images captured from Earth by satellite and aircraft have become increasingly important in several environmental and ecological contexts (e.g. agriculture and urban areas). In the present study we propose an iterative learning methodology for the change detection of HS scenes taken at different times in the same areas. It cascades clustering and classification through iterative learning, in order to separate salient regions, where a change occurs in the scene from the unchanged background. The iterative learning is evaluated in both the clustering and the classification steps. The experiments performed with the proposed methodology provide encouraging results, also compared to several recent state-of-the-art competitors.","92645":"Neural networks are getting wider and deeper to achieve state-of-the-art results in various machine learning domains. Such networks result in complex structures, high model size, and computational costs. Moreover, these networks are failing to adapt to new data due to their isolation in the specific domain-target space. To tackle these issues, we propose a sparse learning method to train the existing network on new classes by selecting non-crucial parameters from the network. Sparse learning also manages to keep the performance of existing classes with no additional network structure and memory costs by employing an effective node selection technique, which analyzes and selects unimportant parameters by using information theory in the neuron distribution of the fully connected layers. Our method could learn up to 40% novel classes without notable loss in the accuracy of existing classes. Through experiments, we show how a sparse learning method competes with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and even surpasses the performance of related algorithms in terms of efficiency in memory, processing speed, and overall training time. Importantly, our method can be implemented in both small and large applications, and we justify this by using well-known networks such as LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG-16.","92647":"The position information of aspect is essential and useful for aspect-based sentiment analysis, while how to model the position of the aspect effectively during aspect-based sentiment analysis has not been well studied. Inspired by the intuition that the position prediction can help boost the performance of aspect-based sentiment analysis, we propose a D eep M ulti-T ask L earning (DMTL) model, which handles sentiment prediction (SP) and position prediction (PP) simultaneously. In particular, we first use a shared layer to learn the common features of the two tasks. Then, two task-specific layers are utilized to learn the features specific to the tasks and perform position prediction and sentiment prediction in parallel. Inspired by autoencoder structure, we design a position-aware attention and a deep bi-directional LSTM (DBi-LSTM) model for sentiment prediction and position prediction respectively to capture the position information better. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of aspect-based sentiment analysis compared with the strong baselines.","92648":"Deep learning frameworks(such as deep convolutional networks) require data to have a regular shape. However, discrete features extracted from heterogeneous data cannot be collected in a regular shape to convolute. In this article, a Two-Dimensional Discrete Feature Based Spatial Attention CapsNet(TDACAPS) is proposed to convert one-dimensional discrete features into two-dimensional structured data through Cartesian Product for surface electromyogram(sEMG) signal recognition. sEMG signal varies from person to person is the main signal source of prosthetic control. Our model transforms multi-angle discrete features into structured data to find the inherent law of sEMG signal. Due to uneven information distribution of structured data, this model combines capsule network with attention mechanism to place emphasis on abundant information regions and reduce ancillary information loss. Extensive experiments show our model yields an improvement for sEMG signal recognition of almost 3% than capsule network and other neural networks under different conditions. Our attention mechanism that employs overlapping pooling to search feature map weight is preferable to the squeeze-and-excitation module, convolutional block attention module and others. Moreover, we validate that our model has great expansibility on Wine Quality Dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin.","92649":"According to the problem that the multi-scale vehicle objects in traffic surveillance video are difficult to detect and the overlapping objects are prone to missed detection, an improved vehicle object detection method based on YOLOv3 was proposed. In order to extract feature more efficiently, we first use the inverted residuals technique to improve the convolutional layer of YOLOv3. To solve the multi-scale vehicle object detection problem, three spatial pyramid pooling(SPP) modules are added before each YOLO layer to obtain multi-scale information. In order to cope with the overlapping of vehicles in traffic videos, soft non maximum suppression (Soft-NMS) is used to replace non maximum suppression (NMS), thereby reducing the missing of predicted boxes due to vehicle overlaps. Our experiment results in the Car dataset and the KITTI dataset confirm that the proposed method achieves good detection results for vehicle objects of various scales in various scenes. Our method can meet the needs of practical applications better.","93121":"In this study, an image processing based indoor positioning system (IPS) scheme is presented. Real-time image of uniquely coded passive reflective tags which are illuminated by an infrared projector is used to calculate the instantaneous position of an object. The system simultaneously provides real-time position data and identifies unregistered tags and makes it possible to use these tags in later frames. The ideal state of the method is to determine the position using the tags with known locations. However, for ease of installation, known tags are placed only at certain reference points and positions of the remaining tags are calculated by applying a proposed auto-registration procedure. Such an approach provides a high level of ease of installation to the presented method. The satisfactory positioning accuracy level obtained in the experimental results also enables the proposed method to be evaluated as a powerful indoor positioning system.","93122":"Maps generated by many visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms consist of geometric primitives such as points, lines or planes. These maps offer a topographic representation of the environment, but they contain no semantic information about the environments. Object classifiers leveraging advances in machine learning are highly accurate and reliable, capable of detecting and classifying thousands of objects. Classifiers can be incorporated into a SLAM pipeline to add semantic information to a scene. Frequently, this semantic information is conducted for each frame of the image, but semantic labeling is not persistent over time. In this work, we present a nonparametric statistical approach to perform matching\/association of objects detected over consecutive image frames. These associated classified objects are then localized in the accrued map using an unsupervised clustering method. We test our approach on multiple data sets, and it shows strong performance in terms of objects correctly associated from frame to frame. We also have tested our algorithm on three data sets in our lab environment using tag markers to demonstrate the accuracy of classified object localization process.","93216":"This paper considers the adaptive event-triggered \n$$H_{\\infty }$$\n\n control issue for Markov jump systems with generally uncertain transition rates and actuator faults. Compared with the conventional method, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism with a varying threshold is adopted to save the communication resources effectively. The general model of transition rates in Markov jump process includes completely unknown and uncertain bounded as two special models. Based on linear matrix inequalities, the sufficient conditions of the controller design can be obtained to guarantee the closed-loop systems are stochastically stable. Finally, simulation examples are exploited to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","93217":"This paper addresses the output-tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear sandwich systems with external disturbances and model uncertainties. Sandwich systems are a special class of nonlinear systems in the cascade structure, which are made up of several distinct subsystems while the non-smooth nonlinear functions are sandwiched among their separate subsystems. This paper concentrates on the sandwich systems consisting of two arbitrary-order nonlinear cascaded subsystems, while the saturation nonlinearity is sandwiched between them. The robust control law is designed such that the output of the sandwich system tracks the desired time-varying reference signal despite the saturation occurrence. Due to the characteristics of the saturation function and also the existence of the external disturbances and model uncertainties, the considered problem is facing some serious challenges. To deal with these difficulties, the design procedure is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the second subsystem and the sandwiched saturation nonlinearity are considered. In this phase, by utilizing the backstepping approach, the desired input signal of the saturation function is designed. In the second phase, the control input of the first subsystem is designed based on the sliding mode technique in a way that the output of the first subsystem tracks the desired signal which is obtained in the first phase. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to a practical sandwich system.","93218":"One subject that has been considered less is a binary classification on data streams with concept drifting in which only information of one class (target class) is available for learning. Well-known methods such as SVDD and convex hull have tried to find the enclosed boundary around target class, but their high complexity makes them unsuitable for large data sets and also online tasks. This paper presents a novel online one-class classifier adapted to the streaming data. Considering time complexity, an incremental convex\u2013concave hull classification method, called ICCHC, is proposed which can significantly reduce the computational time and expand the target class boundary. Also, it can be adapted to the gradual concept drift. Evaluations have been conducted on seventeen real-world data sets by hold-out validation. Also, noise analysis has been carried out. The results of the experiments have been compared with the state-of-the-art methods, which show the superiority of ICCHC regarding the accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.","93219":"The cascaded integrator\u2013comb (CIC) filter is a key building block for communication and sample rate conversion systems that require efficient implementation. One such example is in satellite applications. Space applications have the problem of being highly susceptible to cosmic radiation, which in turn has the possibility of corrupting data. It is therefore necessary to devise techniques that detect errors with as little resource usage as possible in order to meet the usually strict constraints in space applications. Presented in this paper are two techniques derived from studying the behaviour of the interpolation version of the filter. The first being a parallel prediction technique improves upon DMR in terms of resource usage and offers very close error protection coverage. The second offers a trade-off of resource utilisation against error detection.","93220":"In this work, a switched capacitor-based successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using a passive reference charge sharing and charge accumulation is proposed. For N-bit resolution, the fully differential version of this architecture needs only 6 capacitors, which is a significant improvement over conventional binary-weighted SAR ADC. The proposed SAR ADC is first modeled in MATLAB, and the effect of practical operational transconductance amplifier limitations such as finite values of gain, unity-gain bandwidth and slew rate on ADC characteristics is verified through behavioral simulations. To validate the proposed ADC performance, an 11-bit 2\u00a0kS\/s SAR ADC is designed and laid out in UMC 180\u00a0nm 1P6M CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 1.8\u00a0V. The total design occupies an area of $$568\\,\\upmu \\hbox {m} \\times 298\\,\\upmu \\hbox {m}$$ and consumes a power as less as $$0.28\\,\\upmu \\hbox {W}$$.

On the other hand, the median selection improves the mean value of the spurious free dynamic range from 94.09 to 128.85\u00a0dB, while the mean value of the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio is improved from 88.70 to 109.82\u00a0dB.","93225":"This paper discusses the implementation sensitivity of chaotic systems added to their widely discussed sensitivities to initial conditions and parameter variation. This sensitivity can cause mismatches in some applications, which require an exact duplication of the system, e.g., chaos-based cryptography, synchronization and communication. Specifically, different implementation cases of three discretized jerk-based chaotic systems and a discrete-time logistic map are presented corresponding to different orders of additions and multiplications. The cases exhibit roughly similar attractor shapes, bifurcation behavior and Lyapunov exponents. However, mismatches between the time series corresponding to these cases in software double-precision, single-precision floating-point and hardware fixed-point implementations are reported. The number of time units after which the mismatch starts to become noticeable, and the effects of the discretization step and precision are discussed. Experimental results on Artix-7 XC7A100T FPGA and oscilloscope validate the presence of mismatch reported through simulations. The wrong decryption effect of this mismatch is demonstrated for a software image encryption application, where one case is used for encryption and the other(s) for decryption. Pseudo-Random Number Generation and image encryption application using the mismatch signal as a chaotic generator are proposed and show good results using several well-established performance metrics.","93226":"This paper presents a novel spike detection algorithm in nonstationary signals using a time\u2013frequency (t\u2013f) approach. The proposed algorithm exploits the direction of signal energy in the t\u2013f domain to detect spikes in the presence of high-frequency nonstationary signals even at low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic nonstationary signals, synthesized signals mimicking electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, manually selected segments of speech signals, and manually selected segments of real EEG signals. The statistical measures, such as hit rate and precision, are used to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than other widely used algorithms, such as the smoothed nonlinear energy detector.","93227":"Margin setting algorithm (MSA) is a new sphere-based classification algorithm. It employs an artificial immune system approach to construct a number of hyperspheres that cover each class of a given set of data. To gain insights into the classification performance of MSA, it is the first work to analyze two important fundamental problems of MSA as a sphere-based classifier. First, single sphere or multiple spheres are needed to achieve good classification performance in MSA? This problem was presented as sphere analysis, which was experimentally carried out on simulation data sets using Monte Carlo method. The results demonstrated that MSA employs a multiple-sphere strategy instead of one-sphere strategy as its decision boundaries. This strategy allows MSA to achieve lower probabilities of classification error rate. Second, how to adapt the location and size of the hypersphere to achieve good classification performance? This problem was presented as adaption analysis, which was experimentally carried out on real-world data sets compared to the support vector machine and the artificial neural network. The results demonstrated that MSA employs an artificial immune system approach to optimize the locations of the hyperspheres and to shrink the radius of the hypersphere in a certain range using margin as an algorithm parameter. Overall, computational results indicate the advantages of MSA in classification performance.","93228":"The asymmetry of different misclassification costs is a common problem in many realistic applications. As one of the most familiar preprocessing methods, cost-sensitive resampling has drawn great attention due to its easy-implemented and universal properties. However, current methods mainly concentrate on changing the amount of the training set, which will alter the original distribution shapes and lead to the classifiers be over-fitted or unstable. For this case, a new method named cost-sensitive kernel shifting is proposed. The training data are remapped from the input space to the feature space by a particular kernel function, in which a distance metric is defined. Then the outliers are eliminated and the informative samples, including border and edge samples are selected due to the neighbor and geometrical information in the mapped space. Thirdly the positions of all the selected samples in the feature space are shifted. A moving step length is defined in proportion to both the ratio and different of the misclassification costs. In all steps only the kernel matrix is needed to be reshaped due to the kernel trick. Experiments on both synthetic and public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","93229":"Subband adaptive filtering algorithms can increase the convergence rate of system identification tasks when the input signal is colored. Recently, a new normalized subband adaptive filtering algorithm with sparse subfilters (NSAF-SF) has been proposed, whose main advantage is the lower computational complexity when compared to state-of-the-art subband approaches, while maintaining similar convergence performance. In this paper, the first- and second-order stochastic analyses of the NSAF-SF algorithm are presented in order to provide predictions about its transient and steady-state performances. A relationship between the adaptive subband coefficients and the ideal fullband transfer function is derived, and the algorithm is proven to produce an asymptotically unbiased solution. In addition, a closed-form expression is obtained for the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the subfilter coefficients. Although the proposed analyses use conventional assumptions of statistical independence, they do not assume a specific stochastic characteristic for the input signal (e.g., Gaussianity or whiteness). Transient and steady-state theoretical predictions of the MSD are confirmed by simulations.","93230":"A new computational technique for the reduction of multi-time scale systems is proposed in this paper. The reduction process is performed based on the dominant poles preservation in the reduced-order model. The true dominant poles are selected based on the highest contribution in redefined time moments and lowest contribution in redefined Markov parameters. Motivated by the singular perturbation approximation, obtaining the reduced-order model will be achieved by using the artificial intelligent method named particles swarm optimization. The potential of the proposed technique is observed when comparing its results with other recently published methods.","93231":"This work attempts to recognize emotions from human speech using prosodic information represented by variations in duration, energy, and fundamental frequency (\n$$F_{0}$$\n\n) values. For this, the speech signal is first automatically segmented into syllables. Prosodic features at the utterance\u00a0(15 features) and syllable level\u00a0(10 features) are extracted using the syllable boundaries and trained separately using deep neural network\u00a0classifiers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on German speech corpus-EMOTional Sensitivity ASistance System\u00a0(EmotAsS)\u00a0for people with disabilities, the dataset used for the Interspeech 2018 Atypical Affect Sub-Challenge. The initial set of prosodic features on evaluation yields an unweighted average recall\u00a0(UAR)\u00a0of 30.15%. A fusion of the decision scores of these features with spectral features gives a UAR of 36.71%. This paper also employs methods like attention mechanism and feature selection using resampling-based recursive feature elimination\u00a0(RFE)\u00a0to enhance system performance. Implementing attention and feature selection followed by a score-level fusion improves the UAR to 36.83% and 40.96% for prosodic features and overall fusion, respectively. The fusion of the scores of the best individual system of the Atypical Affect Sub-Challenge and the proposed system provides a UAR\u00a0(43.71%) above the best test result reported. The effectiveness of the proposed system has also been demonstrated on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture\u00a0(IEMOCAP) database with a UAR of 63.83%.","93232":"This paper studies the dissipative control problem for two-dimensional (2-D) switched discrete-time linear system represented by Fornasini\u2013Marchesini local state-space (FMLSS) model via dwell-time-dependent Lyapunov function (DTDLF) approach. Consider the definition of (Q,\u00a0S,\u00a0R)-\n$$\\alpha $$\n\n-dissipativity for 2-D switched discrete FMLSS model in triangular region and based on the DTDLF approach, we first give the linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based sufficient condition on asymptotic stability for the 2-D switched discrete FMLSS model and then propose the LMI-based sufficient condition which can guarantee the given 2-D switched system to be asymptotically stable and strictly (Q,\u00a0S,\u00a0R)-\n$$\\alpha $$\n\n-dissipative. Furthermore, the dwell-time-dependent dissipative state-feedback controller is designed, and the LMI-based sufficient condition for designing such controller is proposed. Besides, dwell-time-dependent passive state-feedback controller and dwell-time-dependent \n$$H_\\infty $$\n\n state-feedback controller could be derived as the special cases of dissipative control from the established result. Finally, illustrative examples are depicted to verify the efficiency and superiority of the proposed techniques.","93233":"A new model order reduction (MOR) method for large-scale time-delay differential algebra systems is proposed herein. The presented MOR algorithm is based on parametric moment matching and \n$$\\varepsilon $$\n\n-embedding. By selecting an appropriate projection matrix, this process generates reduced-order models that preserve the structure of the original time-delay differential algebra system. Additionally, moment-matching results and error estimations are provided. Finally, two numerical circuits are tested to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOR method.","93234":"The short-time fractional Fourier transform (STFrFT) is beneficial for addressing non-stationary signals in many application settings. However, the STFrFT algorithm fails to obtain a high time\u2013frequency (TF) concentration because of the uncertainty principle. To resolve these problems, we introduce a new algorithm that is referred to as the SSTFrFT, which is a combination of the synchroextracting transform and STFrFT. The main principle of this algorithm is to establish a synchroextracting operator based on the STFrFT and then to extract the TF coefficient of the ridgeline position in the TF distribution to improve the concentration. Using numerical simulations with two examples (linear frequency modulation signal and nonlinear frequency modulation signal), we illustrate how the algorithm can be useful in improving concentration. The instantaneous frequency estimation and energy distribution description are more accurate than traditional methods, such as the short-time Fourier transform, Wigner Ville distribution, synchrosqueezed transform, and STFrFT. Furthermore, we apply the algorithm to identify the frequency curve generated by the target\u2019s motion from Ice Multiparameter Imaging X-Band radar echo data from the sea clutter background. The test results of the SSTFrFT method that we developed can accurately distinguish moving targets and sea clutter, which suggest the possible utility of this approach for detection and motion characteristics of marine moving targets.","93235":"This paper proposes a finite-time observer-based controller for time-delay descriptor systems with time-varying disturbances, model uncertainties, and one-sided Lipschitz nonlinearities. For this purpose, first, a nonlinear descriptor observer is designed, and the observer error system is calculated. Then, the observer-based control law is proposed to provide the conditions for robust stabilization of the closed-loop descriptor system by selecting an appropriate Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional. According to the delay-dependent stability criterion, LMI-based sufficient conditions are derived and the gains of the controller and the observer are calculated. The proposed controller guarantees the finite-time boundedness and H\u221e disturbance attenuation of the closed-loop descriptor system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is investigated through computer simulations.","93237":"Identification of product attributes is an important matter in real-world business environments because customers generally make purchase decisions based on their evaluation of the attributes of the product. Numerous studies on product attribute extraction have been performed on the basis of user-generated textual reviews. However, most of them focused only on the attribute extraction process itself and not on the relative importance of the extracted attributes, which are critical information that can be utilized for the promotion or development of specification sheets. Thus, in this study, we focused on the development of an attribute set for a product by considering the relative importance of the extracted attributes. First, we extracted the aspects by utilizing convolutional neural network-based approaches and transfer learning. Second, we propose a novel approach, consisting of variants of the Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm, one of the explainable neural network frameworks, to capture the importance score of each extracted aspect. Using a sentimental prediction model, we calculated the weight of each aspect that affects the sentiment decision. We verified the performance of our proposed method by comparing the similarity of the product attributes that it extracted and their relative importance with the product attributes that customers consider to be the most important and by comparing the attributes used to develop the specification sheet of an existing major commercial site.","93238":"The division datapath is undoubtedly the most complex operation in a wide range of digital signal processing applications, such as in adaptive filtering algorithms. This paper proposes an optimized and approximate integer divider hardware architecture, based on the Newton\u2013Raphson algorithm combining both fixed-point dynamic range and truncation techniques, to speed up that operation. Adaptive filters have been much studied over time, as they comprise one of the most challenging fields in signal processing. This work presents dedicated hardware architectures based on normalized least mean square adaptive filtering algorithms for the power line harmonics interference cancelling. The hardware architectures are based on 2\u2019s complement representation and were described in VHDL and synthesized into a 65\u00a0nm CMOS dedicated ASIC. Our results show that the increased approximation level of Newton\u2013Raphson divider approximation presents up to 223 times less power dissipation than the baseline version without our optimization and approximations, providing up to 93 times of power dissipation savings in the complete interference canceller system.","93380":"Polar codes have received a lot of attention due to their capacity-achieving performance and low complexity. This paper proposes a novel scaling offset min-sum (SOMS) algorithm and adapts the offset min-sum (OMS) algorithm for polar codes, and both algorithms are improved via learning. For all message updates, conventional min-sum decoding algorithms use the same scaling factor or offset, which is usually obtained by numerical simulations. By modeling the data flow of min-sum algorithms as a deep neural network, the parameters used in the message passing updates of min-sum decoders can be different for each message update, and are obtained by training and optimizing the corresponding deep neural network. The simulation results show that the proposed SOMS algorithm based on deep learning performs better than all existing BP-based algorithms. Moreover, this paper presents an efficient hardware architecture of the proposed SOMS algorithm. The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to reduce the number of possible parameters of the neural network, leading to reduced energy consumption and memory requirement with negligible error performance degradation. The proposed architecture of the SOMS algorithm for a (256,128) polar code is implemented and validated on the Xilinx Artix-7 field-programmable gate array.","93967":"Countless cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports are used by companies around the world on a daily basis for security reasons. To secure critical cybersecurity information, analysts and individuals should accordingly analyze information on threats and vulnerabilities. However, analyzing such overwhelming volumes of reports requires considerable time and effort. In this study, we propose a novel approach that automatically extracts core information from CTI reports using a named entity recognition (NER) system. During the process of constructing our proposed NER system, we defined meaningful keywords in the security domain as entities, including malware, domain\/URL, IP address, Hash, and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Furthermore, we linked these keywords with the words extracted from the text data of the report. To achieve a higher performance, we utilized the character-level feature vector as an input to bidirectional long-short-term memory using a conditional random field network. We finally achieved an average F1-score of 75.05%. We release 498,000 tag datasets created during our research.","93968":"Despite the benefits mentioned in previous works of automatically acquiring skills for using them in hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms such as solving the curse of dimensionality, improving exploration, and speeding up value propagation, they have not paid much attention to evaluating the effect of each skill on these factors. In this paper, we show that depending on the given task, a skill may be useful for learning it or not. In addition, the focus of the related work of automatically acquiring skills is on detecting subgoals, i.e., the skill termination condition, but there is not a precise method for extracting the initiation set of skills. In this paper, we propose not only two methods for evaluating skills but also two other methods for pruning the initiation set of them. Experimental results show significant improvements in learning different test domains after evaluating and pruning skills.","94200":"Different research traditions have developed over time to study the quantitative aspects of information and knowledge production, such as scientometrics, bibliometrics, librametrics, informetrics, cybermetrics, webometrics, or altmetrics. These information metrics, or iMetrics, as they were labeled by Milojevi\u0107 and Leydesdorff in Scientometrics 95(1):141\u2013157, 2013, are unified by the usage of quantitative data analysis, applying various statistical methods and techniques and are often used to supplement and complement each other. Representing different research traditions, they jointly form a common research field, a \u201cdiscipline with many names\u201d. In this article, we look at the development of iMetrics field and its evolution over time using bibliometric network analysis and identify its common basis, formed by the most important publications, journals, scholars and topics. The dataset consists of articles from the Web of Science database (26,414 records with complete descriptions). Analyzing the citation network, we evaluate the field\u2019s growth and identify the most cited works. Using the Search path count (SPC) approach, we extract the Main path, Key\u00a0routes paths, and Link islands in the citation network. The results show that in the last forty years the number of published papers increased, and it doubles every 8 years; the number of single author papers dropped from 50 to 10\u00a0%, and the number of papers authored by 3 or more authors is increasing. We make the conclusions about the field\u2019s development and its current state. We also present the main authors, journals and keywords from the field, which form its common basis.","94202":"The flow visualization of a shock wave\/boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) has been performed using polarization imaging. This technique used the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for flow visualization instead of the intensity information which is used in traditional imaging methods. The experimental results show that the instantaneous structures of SWBLI captured by the polarization imaging are the same as when the intensity information is used, verifying the feasibility of polarization imaging. The image fusion of the DOLP results and the intensity information will further improve the flow visualization effect. Through statistical analysis, it can be shown that polarization imaging would weaken the influence of incident light on imaging, when the intensity of the incident light is not uniform or fluctuates with time.","94203":"This study presented a new multi-species binary coded algorithm, Mendelian evolutionary theory optimization (METO), inspired by the plant genetics. This framework mainly consists of three concepts: first, the \u201cdenaturation\u201d of DNA\u2019s of two different species to produce the hybrid \u201coffspring DNA\u201d. Second, the Mendelian evolutionary theory of genetic inheritance, which explains how the dominant and recessive traits appear in two successive generations. Third, the Epimutation, through which organism resist for natural mutation. The above concepts are reconfigured in order to design the binary meta-heuristic evolutionary search technique. Based on this framework, four evolutionary operators\u2014(1) Flipper, (2) Pollination, (3) Breeding, and (4) Epimutation\u2014are created in the binary domain. In this paper, METO is compared with well-known evolutionary and swarm optimizers: (1) binary hybrid GA, (2) bio-geography-based optimization, (3) invasive weed optimization, (4) shuffled frog leap algorithm, (5) teaching\u2013learning-based optimization, (6) cuckoo search, (7) bat algorithm, (8) gravitational search algorithm, (9) covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, (10) differential evolution, (11) firefly algorithm and (12) social learning PSO. This comparison is evaluated on 30 and 100 variables benchmark test functions, including noisy, rotated, and hybrid composite functions. Kruskal\u2013Wallis statistical rank-based nonparametric H-test is utilized to determine the statistically significant differences between the output distributions of the optimizer, which are the result of the 100 independent runs. The statistical analysis shows that METO is a significantly better algorithm for complex and multi-modal problems with many local extremes.","94428":"In video surveillance systems which incorporate stationary cameras, the first phase of movement object detection is crucial for the correct modelling of the behavior of these objects, as well as being the most complex in terms of execution time. There are many algorithms that provide a reliable and adequate segmentation mask, obtaining real-time ratios for reduced image sizes. However, due to the increased performance of camera hardware, the application of previous methods to sequences with higher resolutions (from 640\u00a0\u00d7 480 to 1920\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01080) is not carried out in real time, compromising their use in real video surveillance systems. In this paper we propose a methodology to reduce the computational requirements of the algorithms, consisting of a reduction of the input frame and, subsequently, an interpolation of the segmentation mask of each method to recover the original frame size. In addition, the viability of this meta-model is analyzed together with the different selected algorithms, evaluating the quality of the resulting segmentation and its gain in terms of computation time.","94570":"Modeling the execution time of the sparse matrix\u2013vector multiplication (SpMV) on a current CPU architecture is especially complex due to (i) irregular memory accesses; (ii) indirect memory referencing; and (iii) low arithmetic intensity. While analytical models may yield accurate estimates for the total number of cache hits\/misses, they often fail to predict accurately the total execution time. In this paper, we depart from the analytic approach to instead leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in order to provide an effective estimation of the performance of the SpMV operation. For this purpose, we present a high-level abstraction of the sparsity pattern of the problem matrix and propose a blockwise strategy to feed the CNN models by blocks of nonzero elements. The experimental evaluation on a representative subset of the matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection demonstrates the robustness of the CNN models for predicting the SpMV performance on an Intel Haswell core. Furthermore, we show how to generalize the network models to other target architectures to estimate the performance of SpMV on an ARM A57 core.","95241":"Policy makers in regions such as Europe are increasingly concerned about the trustworthiness and sovereignty of the foundations of their digital economy, because it often depends on systems operated or manufactured elsewhere. To help curb this problem, we propose the novel notion of a responsible Internet, which provides higher degrees of trust and sovereignty for critical service providers (e.g., power grids) and all kinds of other users by improving the transparency, accountability, and controllability of the Internet at the network-level. A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP. We believe that a responsible Internet is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet and that the concept is useful for clean slate Internet systems as well.","95399":"The deep learning techniques have achieved great success in the application of human activity recognition (HAR). In this paper, we propose a technique for HAR that utilizes the RGB and skeleton information with the help of a convolutional neural network (Convnet) and long short-term memory (LSTM) as a recurrent neural network (RNN). The proposed method has two parts: first, motion representation images like motion history image (MHI) and motion energy image (MEI) have been created from the RGB videos. The convnet has been trained, using these images with feature-level fusion. Second, the skeleton data have been utilized with a proposed algorithm that develops skeleton intensity images, for three views (top, front and side). Each view is first analyzed by a convnet, that generates the set of feature maps, which are fused for further analysis. On top of convnet sub-networks, LSTM has been used to exploit the temporal dependency. The softmax scores from these two independent parts are later combined at the decision level. Apart from the given approach for HAR, this paper also presents a strategy that utilizes the concept of cyclic learning rate to develop a multi-modal neural network by training the model only once to make the system more efficient. The suggested approach privileges for the perfect utilization of RGB and skeleton data available from an RGB-D sensor. The proposed approach has been tested on three famous and challenging multimodal datasets which are UTD-MHAD, CAD-60 and NTU-RGB\u00a0+\u00a0D120. Results have shown that the stated method gives a satisfactory result as compared to the other state-of-the-art systems.","95400":"Action recognition in video is one of the important applications in computer vision. In recent years, the two-stream architecture has made significant progress in action recognition, but it has not systematically explored spatial\u2013temporal features. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and dilated convolution residual network (GD-RN) for action recognition. This method uses ResNet-101 as spatial and temporal stream ConvNet. On the one hand, this paper first sends the action video into the GMM for background subtraction and then sends the video marking the action profile to ResNet-101 for identification and classification. Compared with the baseline, ConvNet takes the original RGB image as input, which not only reduces the complexity of the video background, but also reduces the amount of computation of the learning space information. On the other hand, using the stacked optical flow images as the input of the ResNet-101 added to the dilated convolution, the convolution receptive field is expanded without lowering the resolution of the optical flow image, thereby improving the classification accuracy. The two ConvNet-independent learning spatial and temporal features of the GD-RN network finally fine-tune and fuse the spatio-temporal features to obtain the final action recognition accuracy. The action recognition method proposed in this paper is tested on the challenging UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, and accuracy rates of 91.3% and 62.4%, respectively, are obtained, which proves the proposed method with the competitive results.","95402":"This work proposes a new integer linear programming model for tactical and operational planning of the blood supply chain. A two-stage approach is developed with a first aggregated stage to establish tactical planning decisions and a second disaggregated stage for the operational level. The model considers multi-products, multi-periods and perishability in a large planning horizon. Inventory levels as well as waste of whole blood and blood-derived products are also modelled. A purchase flow is introduced to handle situations of not enough collection to satisfy demand. The objective is cost minimisation whilst reducing waste and dependence on other regions through purchase. A case study of the South Region of Portugal is explored, demonstrating the possibility of decreased dependency and waste by adjusting allocation of facilities and allowing a more even distribution of activities between processing centres. This is the first study of the kind ever conducted on the Portuguese blood supply chain.","95403":"Due to the low compression performance of traditional compression models, we have developed a new HOA based Fractional KCA with 2D-DWT for improving the multispectral image quality. In this paper, we present a novel multispectral image compression method for improving the complexity by maintaining quality reconstruction and also reducing the size of the storage of multispectral images. Initially, Karhunen\u2013Loeve transform (KLT) is used to remove the spatial redundancies. In the second stage, 2D DWT is used to eliminate the intraband spatial redundancies. In the third stage, Fractional KCA (FKCA) is applied to improve the post-transformation process. FKCA is connected to the band of all wavelet sub-bands to minimize the spatial redundancy between intra sub-bands. Finally, the Hybrid Optimal algorithm (HOA) based FKCA is used to eliminate the residual and information redundancy among the neighboring bands. The experimental analysis of proposed 2D-DWT based Fractional KCA shows that the model improves the performance of compression data in terms of PSNR, MSSI, and VIF. Also, the multispectral image dataset shows the proposed compression model outperforms the existing compression models such as FKLT\u2009+\u2009PCA, ADWT\u2009+\u2009OADL, and DWT\u2009+\u2009DCT","95404":"We investigate the impact of coordinating the timetable and the crew schedule in an operational freight railway system. Usually, those problems are solved sequentially\u2014resulting in suboptimal schedules for train drivers due to large idle times between two train rides. We seek to coordinate the timetable and the crew schedule on the operational level by adding flexibility to the timetable. We introduce small time windows that allow to shift entire trains forwards and backwards by discrete time periods. We present a mathematical model and solve it with a column generation heuristic. We test our model on three real datasets of a major European Freight Railway Operator and show that significant reduction in idle time and cost can be achieved.","95406":"Visual Object Tracking is a very challenging task because of the large appearance variance caused by illumination, deformation, and motion. Siamese network-based trackers, which select target through a matching function, are widely used for visual object tracking. The trackers are capable of robustly recognizing the target with appearance variance. However, while the filter template is a crucial part of such methods, most of them did not update the filter template effectively, and have shown limited discriminative ability between target and similar semantic objects (distractors). In order to tackle the challenge of distractors, we added a dynamic filter branch on the traditional siamese network. Under the condition that multipeaks are detected on the static response map, the tracker will redetect target with dynamic branch and the final target location will be determined by the combined result of the dynamic filter branch and static filter branch. Subsequently the sample library with hard negative mining strategy is updated and the dynamic filter kernel is restrained online. With the fusion of two branches, the tracker can distinguish the true target from similar objects. Meanwhile, we conduct extensive experiments and empirical evaluations on two popular datasets: Visdrone and UAV123. Our tracker achieves an AUC of 58% on Visdrone dataset and an AUC of 60.7% on UAV123 dataset.","95407":"In outpatient chemotherapy, nurses administer the drugs in two steps. In the first few minutes of each appointment, a nurse prepares the patient for infusion (drug administration). During the remainder of the appointment, the patient is monitored by nurses and if needed taken care of. One nurse must be assigned to prepare the patient and set up the infusion device. However, a nurse who is not busy setting up may simultaneously monitor up to a certain number of patients who are already receiving infusion. The prescribed infusion durations are significantly different among the patients on a day at a clinic. We formulate this problem as a multi-criterion mixed integer program. The appointments should be scheduled with start times close to patients\u2019 ready times, balanced workload among nurses, few nurse changes during appointments, and few nurse full-time equivalent (FTE) assigned to the schedule of the day. As the number of nurse FTEs is an output of the model rather than a fixed input, the clinic can use the nursing capacity more efficiently, i.e., with less labor cost. We develop a 3-stage heuristic for finding criterion points with the minimum weighted average deferring time of appointments for the minimum feasible number of nurse FTEs or a desired value above that. By not constraining the number of chairs or beds, we can find solutions with better (dominating) criterion points. Drug preparation, oncologist visit, and the laboratory test can be scheduled based on the drug administration appointment start time. Thus, the drug administration resources are efficiently used with desirable performance in taking the interests and requirements of various stakeholders into consideration: patients, nurses, oncologists, pharmacy, and the clinic.","95408":"Most state-of-the-art multiple-object tracking (MOT) methods adopt the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, which is a two-step procedure including the detection module and the tracking module. In these methods, the tracking performance heavily depends on initial detections and data association. In this paper, we present an online MOT method by introducing a single-object tracking (SOT) based on correlation filter. Our contributions lie in twofold: (a) we use the KCF-based SOT in learning of discriminative target appearance relying on handcrafted and deep features and (b) we employ the predicted result to refine the detection mistakes in a new way. Furthermore, we introduce normalize APCE score as an occlusion indicator of tracklet confidence, and build a candidate target hypotheses set to improve the association performance. Both approaches are found beneficial to eliminate the track errors caused by the inability of association algorithm. The experimental results, both qualitative and quantitative on three benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our tracking algorithm achieves comparable or even better results than competitor approaches.","95409":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly viewed as useful tools to assist humanitarian response in recent years. While organisations already employ UAVs for damage assessment during relief delivery, there is a lack of research into formalising a problem that considers both aspects simultaneously. This paper presents a novel endogenous stochastic vehicle routing problem that coordinates UAV and relief vehicle deployments to minimise overall mission cost. The algorithm considers stochastic damage levels in a transport network, with UAVs surveying the network to determine the actual network damages. Ground vehicles are simultaneously routed based on the information gathered by the UAVs.\nA case study based on the Haiti road network is solved using a greedy solution approach and an adapted genetic algorithm. Both methods provide a significant improvement in vehicle travel time compared to a deterministic approach and a non-assisted relief delivery operation, demonstrating the benefits of UAV-assisted response.","95410":"Spotters (also denoted as switchers) are specialized terminal tractors, which are dedicated to the rapid maneuvering of semitrailers between parking lot and dock doors in large trailer yards. This paper is dedicated to spotter scheduling, i.e., the assignment of predefined trailer movements to a given fleet of spotters. The limited number of dock doors for loading and unloading is often the scarce resource during trailer processing, so that idle time of the bottleneck, e.g., caused by unforeseen delay in the yard, is to be avoided. In this setting, we aim to insert time buffers between any pair of subsequent jobs assigned to the same spotter, so that small delays are not propagated and subsequent jobs can still be executed in a timely manner. We formalize two versions of the resulting robust spotter scheduling problem and provide efficient algorithms for finding optimal solutions in polynomial time. Furthermore, we simulate delays during the execution of spotter schedules and show that the right robustness objective can greatly improve yard performance.","95411":"Route restoration is considered to be a task of foremost priority in disaster relief. In this paper, we propose a robust optimization approach for post-disaster route restoration under uncertain restoration times. We present a novel decision rule based on restoration time ordering that yields optimal restoration sequencing and propose conditions for complexity reduction in the model and prove probability bounds on the satisfaction of these conditions. We implement our models in a realistic study of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal.","95416":"Deferred-acceptance auctions can be seen as heuristic algorithms to solve \n$${{\\mathcal {N}}}{{\\mathcal {P}}}$$\n\n-hard allocation problems. Such auctions have been used in the context of the Incentive Auction by the US Federal Communications Commission in 2017, and they have remarkable incentive properties. Besides being strategyproof, they also prevent collusion among participants. Unfortunately, the worst-case approximation ratio of these algorithms is very low in general, but it was observed that they lead to near-optimal solutions in experiments on the specific allocation problem of the Incentive Auction. In this work, which is inspired by the telecommunications industry, we focus on a strategic version of the minimum Steiner tree problem, where the edges are owned by bidders with private costs. We design several deferred-acceptance auctions (DAAs) and compare their performance to the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves (VCG) mechanism as well as several other approximation mechanisms. We observe that, even for medium-sized inputs, the VCG mechanisms experiences impractical runtimes and that the DAAs match the approximation ratios of even the best strategy-proof mechanisms in the average case. We thus provide another example of an important practical mechanism design problem, where empirics suggest that carefully designed deferred-acceptance auctions with their superior incentive properties need not come at a cost in terms of allocative efficiency. Our experiments provide insights into the trade-off between solution quality and runtime and into the additional premium to be paid in DAAs to gain weak group-strategyproofness rather than just strategyproofness.","95511":"In this paper, we combine the positive aspects of the gradient sampling (GS) and bundle methods, as the most efficient methods in nonsmooth optimization, to develop a robust method for solving unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problems. The main aim of the proposed method is to take advantage of both GS and bundle methods, meanwhile avoiding their drawbacks. At each iteration of this method, to find an efficient descent direction, the GS technique is utilized for constructing a local polyhedral model for the objective function. If necessary, via an iterative improvement process, this initial polyhedral model is improved by some techniques inspired by the bundle and GS methods. The convergence of the method is studied, which reveals that the global convergence property of our method is independent of the number of gradient evaluations required to establish and improve the initial polyhedral models. Thus, the presented method needs much fewer gradient evaluations in comparison to the original GS method. Furthermore, by means of numerical simulations, we show that the presented method provides promising results in comparison with GS methods, especially for large scale problems. Moreover, in contrast with some bundle methods, our method is not very sensitive to the accuracy of supplied gradients.","95512":"We develop a unified level-bundle method, called accelerated constrained level-bundle (ACLB) algorithm, for solving constrained convex optimization problems. where the objective and constraint functions can be nonsmooth, weakly smooth, and\/or smooth. ACLB employs Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient technique, and hence retains the iteration complexity as that of existing bundle-type methods if the objective or one of the constraint functions is nonsmooth. More importantly, ACLB can significantly reduce iteration complexity when the objective and all constraints are (weakly) smooth. In addition, if the objective contains a nonsmooth component which can be written as a specific form of maximum, we show that the iteration complexity of this component can be much lower than that for general nonsmooth objective function. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","95513":"In this work, we introduce self-adaptive methods for solving variational inequalities with Lipschitz continuous and quasimonotone mapping(or Lipschitz continuous mapping without monotonicity) in real Hilbert space. Under suitable assumptions, the convergence of algorithms are established without the knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the mapping. The results obtained in this paper extend some recent results in the literature. Some preliminary numerical experiments and comparisons are reported.","95514":"We consider nested variational inequalities consisting in a (upper-level) variational inequality whose feasible set is given by the solution set of another (lower-level) variational inequality. Purely hierarchical convex bilevel optimization problems and certain multi-follower games are particular instances of nested variational inequalities. We present an explicit and ready-to-implement Tikhonov-type solution method for such problems. We give conditions that guarantee the convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, inspired by recent works in the literature, we provide a convergence rate analysis. In particular, for the simple bilevel instance, we are able to obtain enhanced convergence results.","95515":"Algorithmic differentiation (AD) is a widely-used approach to compute derivatives of numerical models. Many numerical models include an iterative process to solve non-linear systems of equations. To improve efficiency and numerical stability, AD is typically not applied to the linear solvers. Instead, the differentiated linear solver call is replaced with hand-produced derivative code that exploits the linearity of the original call. In practice, the iterative linear solvers are often stopped prematurely to recompute the linearisation of the non-linear outer loop. We show that in the reverse-mode of AD, the derivatives obtained with partial convergence become inconsistent with the original and the tangent-linear models, resulting in inaccurate adjoints. We present a correction term that restores consistency between adjoint and tangent-linear gradients if linear systems are only partially converged. We prove the consistency of this correction term and show in numerical experiments that the accuracy of adjoint gradients of an incompressible flow solver applied to an industrial test case is restored when the correction term is used.","95516":"The distance between sets is a long-standing computational geometry problem. In robotics, the distance between convex sets with Minkowski sum structure plays a fundamental role in collision detection. However, it is typically nontrivial to be computed, even if the projection onto each component set admits explicit formula. In this paper, we explore the problem of calculating the distance between convex sets arising from robotics. Upon the recent progress in convex optimization community, the proposed model can be efficiently solved by the recent hot-investigated first-order methods, e.g., alternating direction method of multipliers or primal-dual hybrid gradient method. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that those first-order methods are fairly efficient in solving distance problems in robotics.","95517":"This paper is devoted to a numerical method for the approximation of a class of free boundary problems of Bernoulli\u2019s type, reformulated as optimal shape design problems with appropriate shape functionals. We show the existence of the shape derivative of the cost functional on a class of admissible domains and compute its shape derivative by using the formula proposed in Boulkhemair (SIAM J Control Optim 55(1):156\u2013171, 2017) and Boulkhemair and Chakib (J Convex Anal 21(1):67\u201387, 2014), that is, by means of support functions. On the numerical level, this allows us to avoid the tedious computations of the method based on vector fields. A gradient method combined with a\u00a0boundary element method is performed for the approximation of this problem, in order to overcome the re-meshing task required by the finite element method. Finally, we present some numerical results and simulations concerning practical applications, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","96319":"This paper proposes a novel unsupervised video generation that is conditioned on a single structural annotation map, which in contrast to prior conditioned video generation approaches, provides a good balance between motion flexibility and visual quality in the generation process. Different from end-to-end approaches that model the scene appearance and dynamics in a single shot, we try to decompose this difficult task into two easier sub-tasks in a divide-and-conquer fashion, thus achieving remarkable results overall. The first sub-task is an image-to-image (I2I) translation task that synthesizes high-quality starting frame from the input structural annotation map. The second image-to-video (I2V) generation task applies the synthesized starting frame and the associated structural annotation map to animate the scene dynamics for the generation of a photorealistic and temporally coherent video. We employ a cycle-consistent flow-based conditioned variational autoencoder to capture the long-term motion distributions, by which the learned bi-directional flows ensure the physical reliability of the predicted motions and provide explicit occlusion handling in a principled manner. Integrating structural annotations into the flow prediction also improves the structural awareness in the I2V generation process. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations over the autonomous driving and human action datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods. The code has been released: \nhttps:\/\/github.com\/junting\/seg2vid\n\n.","96320":"We present a method for photo-realistic face manipulation. Given a single RGB face image with an arbitrary expression, our method can synthesize another arbitrary expression of the same person. To achieve this, we first fit a 3D face model and disentangle the face into its texture and shape. We then train separate networks in each of these spaces. In texture space, we use a conditional generative network to change the appearance, and carefully design the input format and loss functions to achieve the best results. In shape space, we use a fully connected network to predict an accurate face shape. When available, the shape branch uses depth data for supervision. Both networks are conditioned on expression coefficients rather than discrete labels, allowing us to generate an unlimited number of expressions. Furthermore, we adopt spatially adaptive denormalization on our texture space representation to improve the quality of the synthesized results. We show the superiority of this disentangling approach through both quantitative and qualitative studies. The proposed method does not require paired data, and is trained using an in-the-wild dataset of videos consisting of talking people. To achieve this, we present a simple yet efficient method to select appropriate key frames from these videos. In a user study, our method is preferred in 83.2% of cases when compared to state-of-the-art alternative approaches.","96321":"Detecting subtle differences in visual attributes requires inferring which of two images exhibits a property more, e.g., which face is smiling slightly more, or which shoe is slightly more sporty. While valuable for applications ranging from biometrics to online shopping, fine-grained attributes are challenging to learn. Unlike traditional recognition tasks, the supervision is inherently comparative. Thus, the space of all possible training comparisons is vast, and learning algorithms face a sparsity of supervision problem: it is difficult to curate adequate subtly different image pairs for each attribute of interest. We propose to overcome this problem by densifying the space of training images with attribute-conditioned image generation. The main idea is to create synthetic but realistic training images exhibiting slight modifications of attribute(s), obtain their comparative labels from human annotators, and use the labeled image pairs to augment real image pairs when training ranking functions for the attributes. We introduce two variants of our idea. The first passively synthesizes training images by \u201cjittering\u201d individual attributes in real training images. Building on this idea, our second model actively synthesizes training image pairs that would confuse the current attribute model, training both the attribute ranking functions and a generation controller simultaneously in an adversarial manner. For both models, we employ a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to perform image synthesis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of bootstrapping imperfect image generators to counteract supervision sparsity in learning-to-rank models. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance for challenging datasets from two distinct domains.","96322":"Conditional image generation lies at the heart of computer vision and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) have recently become the method of choice for this task, owing to their superior performance. The focus so far has largely been on performance improvement, with little effort in making cGANs more robust to noise. However, the regression (of the generator) might lead to arbitrarily large errors in the output, which makes cGANs unreliable for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional GAN model, called RoCGAN, which leverages structure in the target space of the model to address the issue. Specifically, we augment the generator with an unsupervised pathway, which promotes the outputs of the generator to span the target manifold, even in the presence of intense noise. We prove that RoCGAN share similar theoretical properties as GAN and establish with both synthetic and real data the merits of our model. We perform a thorough experimental validation on large scale datasets for natural scenes and faces and observe that our model outperforms existing cGAN architectures by a large margin. We also empirically demonstrate the performance of our approach in the face of two types of noise (adversarial and Bernoulli).","96323":"Density estimation is a challenging unsupervised learning problem. Current maximum likelihood approaches for density estimation are either restrictive or incapable of producing high-quality samples. On the other hand, likelihood-free models such as generative adversarial networks, produce sharp samples without a density model. The lack of a density estimate limits the applications to which the sampled data can be put, however. We propose a generative adversarial density estimator (GADE), a density estimation approach that bridges the gap between the two. Allowing for a prior on the parameters of the model, we extend our density estimator to a Bayesian model where we can leverage the predictive variance to measure our confidence in the likelihood. Our experiments on challenging applications such as visual dialog or autonomous driving where the density and the confidence in predictions are crucial shows the effectiveness of our approach.","96324":"In this paper, we consider the problem of image-to-video translation, where one or a set of input images are translated into an output video which contains motions of a single object. Especially, we focus on predicting motions conditioned by high-level structures, such as facial expression and human pose. Recent approaches are either driven by structural conditions or temporal-based. Condition-driven approaches typically train transformation networks to generate future frames conditioned on the predicted structural sequence. Temporal-based approaches, on the other hand, have shown that short high-quality motions can be generated using 3D convolutional networks with temporal knowledge learned from massive training data. In this work, we combine the benefits of both approaches and propose a two-stage generative framework where videos are forecast from the structural sequence and then refined by temporal signals. To model motions more efficiently in the forecasting stage, we train networks with dense connections to learn residual motions between the current and future frames, which avoids learning motion-irrelevant details. To ensure temporal consistency in the refining stage, we adopt the ranking loss for adversarial training. We conduct extensive experiments on two image-to-video translation tasks: facial expression retargeting and human pose forecasting. Superior results over the state of the art on both tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","97383":"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an ever increasingly popular tool for transcriptome profiling. A key point to make the best use of the available data is to provide software tools that are easy to use but still provide flexibility and transparency in the adopted methods. Despite the availability of many packages focused on detecting differential expression, a method to streamline this type of bioinformatics analysis in a comprehensive, accessible, and reproducible way is lacking. We developed the ideal software package, which serves as a web application for interactive and reproducible RNA-seq analysis, while producing a wealth of visualizations to facilitate data interpretation. ideal is implemented in R using the Shiny framework, and is fully integrated with the existing core structures of the Bioconductor project. Users can perform the essential steps of the differential expression analysis workflow in an assisted way, and generate a broad spectrum of publication-ready outputs, including diagnostic and summary visualizations in each module, all the way down to functional analysis. ideal also offers the possibility to seamlessly generate a full HTML report for storing and sharing results together with code for reproducibility. ideal is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (\n                  http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/ideal\/\n                  \n                ), and provides a solution for performing interactive and reproducible analyses of summarized RNA-seq expression data, empowering researchers with many different profiles (life scientists, clinicians, but also experienced bioinformaticians) to make the ideal use of the data at hand.","97395":"Recent advances in 3d electron microscopy are yielding ever larger reconstructions of brain tissue, encompassing thousands of individual neurons interconnected by millions of synapses. Interpreting reconstructions at this scale demands advances in the automated analysis of neuronal morphologies, for example by identifying morphological and functional subcompartments within neurons. We present a method that for the first time uses full 3d input (voxels) to automatically classify reconstructed neuron fragments as axon, dendrite, or somal subcompartments. Based on 3d convolutional neural networks, this method achieves a mean f1-score of 0.972, exceeding the previous state of the art of 0.955. The resulting predictions can support multiple analysis and proofreading applications. In particular, we leverage finely localized subcompartment predictions for automated detection and correction of merge errors in the volume reconstruction, successfully detecting 90.6% of inter-class merge errors with a false positive rate of only 2.7%.","97431":"Understanding how neural structure varies across individuals is critical for characterizing the effects of disease, learning, and aging on the brain. However, disentangling the different factors that give rise to individual variability is still an outstanding challenge. In this paper, we introduce a deep generative modeling approach to find different modes of variation across many individuals. Our approach starts with training a variational autoencoder on a collection of auto-fluorescence images from a little over 1,700 mouse brains at 25 \\\\(\\\\upmu \\\\)m resolution. We then tap into the learned factors and validate the model\u2019s expressiveness, via a novel bi-directional technique that makes structured perturbations to both, the high-dimensional inputs of the network, as well as the low-dimensional latent variables in its bottleneck. Our results demonstrate that through coupling generative modeling frameworks with structured perturbations, it is possible to probe the latent space of the generative model to provide insights into the representations of brain structure formed in deep networks.","97862":"Modern machine learning methods typically produce \u201cblack box\u201d models that are opaque to interpretation. Yet, their demand has been increasing in the Human-in-the-Loop processes, that is, those processes that require a human agent to verify, approve or reason about the automated decisions before they can be applied. To facilitate this interpretation, we propose Collection of High Importance Random Path Snippets (CHIRPS); a novel algorithm for explaining random forest classification per data instance. CHIRPS extracts a decision path from each tree in the forest that contributes to the majority classification, and then uses frequent pattern mining to identify the most commonly occurring split conditions. Then a simple, conjunctive form rule is constructed where the antecedent terms are derived from the attributes that had the most influence on the classification. This rule is returned alongside estimates of the rule\u2019s precision and coverage on the training data along with counter-factual details. An experimental study involving nine data sets shows that classification rules returned by CHIRPS have a precision at least as high as the state of the art when evaluated on unseen data (0.91\u20130.99) and offer a much greater coverage (0.04\u20130.54). Furthermore, CHIRPS uniquely controls against under- and over-fitting solutions by maximising novel objective functions that are better suited to the local (per instance) explanation setting.","98013":"Science teams for rover-based planetary exploration missions like the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover have limited time for analyzing new data before making decisions about follow-up observations. There is a need for systems that can rapidly and intelligently extract information from planetary instrument datasets and focus attention on the most promising or novel observations. Several novelty detection methods have been explored in prior work for three-channel color images and non-image datasets, but few have considered multispectral or hyperspectral image datasets for the purpose of scientific discovery. We compared the performance of four novelty detection methods\u2014Reed Xiaoli (RX) detectors, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)\u2014and the ability of each method to provide explanatory visualizations to help scientists understand and trust predictions made by the system. We show that pixel-wise RX and autoencoders trained with structural similarity (SSIM) loss can detect morphological novelties that are not detected by PCA, GANs, and mean squared error autoencoders, but that the latter methods are better suited for detecting spectral novelties\u2014i.e., the best method for a given setting depends on the type of novelties that are sought. Additionally, we find that autoencoders provide the most useful explanatory visualizations for enabling users to understand and trust model detections, and that existing GAN approaches to novelty detection may be limited in this respect.","98014":"Tables are a common way to present information in an intuitive and concise manner. They are used extensively in media such as scientific articles or web pages. Automatically analyzing the content of tables bears special challenges. One of the most basic tasks is determination of the orientation of a table: In column tables, columns represent one entity with the different attribute values present in the different rows; row tables are vice versa, and matrix tables give information on pairs of entities. In this paper, we address the problem of classifying a given table into one of the three layouts horizontal (for row tables), vertical (for column tables), and matrix. We describe DeepTable, a novel method based on deep neural networks designed for learning from sets. Contrary to previous state-of-the-art methods, this basis makes DeepTable invariant to the permutation of rows or columns, which is a highly desirable property as in most tables the order of rows and columns does not carry specific information. We evaluate our method using a silver standard corpus of 5500 tables extracted from biomedical articles where the layout was determined heuristically. DeepTable outperforms previous methods in both precision and recall on our corpus. In a second evaluation, we manually labeled a corpus of 300 tables and were able to confirm DeepTable to reach superior performance in the table layout classification task. The codes and resources introduced here are available at \nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Marhabibi\/DeepTable\n\n.","98018":"This paper investigates a practical scheduling problem for radiotherapy patients, who are to be scheduled on different devices at different times. The treatment duration is increasing with time because of the continuously decaying effect of the radiation source, which also results in the decline of the serving ability. Therefore, the maintenance activity (replacing radiation source) is necessary to maintain the serving ability of medical institutions. The problem is to determine the schedule of all treatments and also when to have a maintenance activity, so as to minimize the maximum completion time of all the treatments on all devices. The lower bound of the problem is given in this paper. We prove that the optimal solution of the subproblem, i.e., scheduling patients on a single device, is independent of the sequence of the patients and is only related to the division of patients who are assigned before and after the maintenance, and thus, the subproblem can be converted to a two-partition problem. An improved dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to obtain an optimal scheme for this subproblem and its performance is better than other approaches. For multiple-device problem, an effective hybrid algorithm Gaussian crow search algorithm (GCSA) combined with crow search algorithm (CSA) and Gaussian distribution is proposed to assign all patients to different treatment devices. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed GCSA which is compared with CSA, simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The comparison results show that GCSA outperforms other algorithms in a feasible time.","98055":"Text visualization and visual text analytics methods have been successfully applied for various tasks related to the analysis of individual text documents and large document collections such as summarization of main topics or identification of events in discourse. Visualization of sentiments and emotions detected in textual data has also become an important topic of interest, especially with regard to the data originating from social media. Despite the growing interest in this topic, the research problem related to detecting and visualizing various stances, such as rudeness or uncertainty, has not been adequately addressed by the existing approaches. The challenges associated with this problem include the development of the underlying computational methods and visualization of the corresponding multi-label stance classification results. In this paper, we describe our work on a visual analytics platform, called StanceVis Prime, which has been designed for the analysis of sentiment and stance in temporal text data from various social media data sources. The use case scenarios intended for StanceVis Prime include social media monitoring and research in sociolinguistics. The design was motivated by the requirements of collaborating domain experts in linguistics as part of a larger research project on stance analysis. Our approach involves consuming documents from several text stream sources and applying sentiment and stance classification, resulting in multiple data series associated with source texts. StanceVis Prime provides the end users with an overview of similarities between the data series based on dynamic time warping analysis, as well as detailed visualizations of data series values. Users can also retrieve and conduct both distant and close reading of the documents corresponding to the data series. We demonstrate our approach with case studies involving political targets of interest and several social media data sources and report preliminary user feedback received from a domain expert.","98599":"This paper proposes a new approach for superpixel segmentation. It is formulated as finding a rooted spanning forest of a graph with respect to some roots and a path-cost function. The underlying graph represents an image, the roots serve as seeds for segmentation, each pixel is connected to one seed via a path, the path-cost function measures both the color similarity and spatial closeness between two pixels via a path, and each tree in the spanning forest represents one superpixel. Originating from the evenly distributed seeds, the superpixels are guided by a path-cost function to grow uniformly and adaptively, the pixel-by-pixel growing continues until they cover the whole image. The number of superpixels is controlled by the number of seeds. The connectivity is maintained by region growing. Good performances are assured by connecting each pixel to the similar seed, which are dominated by the path-cost function. It is evaluated by both the superpixel benchmark and supervoxel benchmark. Its performance is ranked as the second among top performing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it is much faster than the other superpixel and supervoxel methods.","99864":"This paper considers a generalized version of the planar storage location problem arising in the stowage planning for Roll-on\/Roll-off ships. A ship is set to sail along a predefined voyage where given cargoes are to be transported between different port pairs along the voyage. We aim at determining the optimal stowage plan for the vehicles stored on a deck of the ship so that the time spent moving vehicles to enable loading or unloading of other vehicles (shifting), is minimized. We propose a novel mixed integer programming model for the problem, considering both the stowage and shifting aspect of the problem. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic with several new destroy and repair operators is developed. We further show how the shifting cost can be effectively evaluated using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm by transforming the stowage plan into a network graph. The computational results show that the ALNS heuristic provides high quality solutions to realistic test instances.","99865":"The weather has a major impact on the profitability, safety, and environmental sustainability of the routes sailed by seagoing vessels. The prevailing weather strongly influences the course of routes, affecting not only the safety of the crew, but also the fuel consumption and therefore the emissions of the vessel. Effective decision support is required to plan the route and the speed of the vessel considering the forecasted weather. We implement a genetic algorithm to minimize the fuel consumption of a vessel taking into account the two most important influences of weather on a ship: the wind and the waves. Our approach assists route planners in finding cost minimal routes that consider the weather, avoid specified areas, and meet arrival time constraints. Furthermore, it supports ship speed control to avoid areas with weather conditions that would result in high fuel costs or risk the safety of the vessel. The algorithm is evaluated for a variety of instances to show the impact of weather routing on the routes and the fuel and travel time savings that can be achieved with our approach. Including weather into the routing leads to a savings potential of over 10% of the fuel consumption. We show that ignoring the weather when constructing routes can lead to routes that cannot be sailed in practice. Furthermore, we evaluate our algorithm with stochastic weather data to show that it can provide high-quality routes under real conditions even with uncertain weather forecasts.","99913":"Identifying one or more biologically-active\/native decoys from millions of non-native decoys is one of the major challenges in computational structural biology. The extreme lack of balance in positive and negative samples (native and non-native decoys) in a decoy set makes the problem even more complicated. Consensus methods show varied success in handling the challenge of decoy selection despite some issues associated with clustering large decoy sets and decoy sets that do not show much structural similarity. Recent investigations into energy landscape-based decoy selection approaches show promises. However, lack of generalization over varied test cases remains a bottleneck for these methods. We propose a novel decoy selection method, ML-Select, a machine learning framework that exploits the energy landscape associated with the structure space probed through a template-free decoy generation. The proposed method outperforms both clustering and energy ranking-based methods, all the while consistently offering better performance on varied test-cases. Moreover, ML-Select shows promising results even for the decoy sets consisting of mostly low-quality decoys. ML-Select is a useful method for decoy selection. This work suggests further research in finding more effective ways to adopt machine learning frameworks in achieving robust performance for decoy selection in template-free protein structure prediction.","100088":"We present a novel approach based on statistical permutation tests for pruning redundant subtrees from genetic programming (GP) trees that allows us to explore the extent of effective redundancy . We observe that over a range of regression problems, median tree sizes are reduced by around 20% largely independent of test function, and that while some large subtrees are removed, the median pruned subtree comprises just three nodes; most take the form of an exact algebraic simplification. Our statistically-based pruning technique has allowed us to explore the hypothesis that a given subtree can be replaced with a constant if this substitution results in no statistical change to the behavior of the parent tree\u2014what we term approximate simplification. In the eventuality, we infer that more than 95% of the accepted pruning proposals are the result of algebraic simplifications, which provides some practical insight into the scope of removing redundancies in GP trees.","107152":"Decision trees are still seeing use in online, non-stationary and embedded contexts, as well as for interpretability. For applications like ranking and cost-sensitive classification, probability estimation trees (PETs) are used. These are built using smoothing or calibration techniques. Older smoothing techniques used counts local to a leaf node, but a few more recent techniques consider the broader context of a node when doing estimation. We apply a recent advanced smoothing method called Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to PETs, and then propose a novel hierarchical smoothing approach called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) as an alternative. HGS smooths leaf nodes up to all the ancestors, instead of recursively smoothing to the parent used by HDP. HGS is made faster by efficiently optimizing the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) loss measure using gradient descent, instead of sampling used in HDP. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on 143 datasets showing that our HGS estimates are not only more accurate but also do so within a fraction of HDP time. Besides, HGS makes a single tree almost as good as a Random Forest with 10 trees. For applications that require more interpretability and efficiency, a single decision tree plus HGS is more preferred.","107827":"The idea of combining the high representational power of deep learning techniques with clustering methods has gained much attention in recent years. Optimizing a clustering objective and the dataset representation simultaneously has been shown to be advantageous over separately optimizing them. So far, however, all proposed methods have been using a flat clustering strategy, with the actual number of clusters known a priori. In this paper, we propose the Deep Embedded Cluster Tree (DeepECT), the first divisive hierarchical embedded clustering method. The cluster tree does not need to know the actual number of clusters during optimization. Instead, the level of detail to be analyzed can be chosen afterward and for each sub-tree separately. An optional data-augmentation-based extension allows DeepECT to ignore prior-known invariances of the dataset, such as affine transformations in image data. We evaluate and show the advantages of DeepECT in extensive experiments.","107828":"In data science, one is often confronted with a time series representing measurements of some quantity of interest. Usually, in a first step, features of the time series need to be extracted. These are numerical quantities that aim to succinctly describe the data and to dampen the influence of noise. In some applications, these features are also required to satisfy some invariance properties. In this paper, we concentrate on time-warping invariants. We show that these correspond to a certain family of iterated sums of the increments of the time series, known as quasisymmetric functions in the mathematics literature. We present these invariant features in an algebraic framework, and we develop some of their basic properties.","107829":"The existing Key Aggregate Searchable Encryption (KASE) schemes allow searches on the encrypted dataset using a single query trapdoor, with a feature to delegate the search rights of multiple files using a constant size key. However, the operations required to generate the ciphertext and decrypt it in these schemes incur higher computational costs, due to the computationally expensive pairing operations in encryption\/decryption. This makes the use of such schemes in resource-constrained devices, such as Radio Frequency Identification Devices, Wireless Sensor Network nodes, Internet of Things nodes, infeasible. Motivated with the goal to reduce the computational cost, in this paper, we propose a Revocable Online\/Offline KASE (R-OO-KASE) scheme, based on the idea of splitting the encryption\/decryption operations into two distinct phases: online and offline. The offline phase computes the majority of costly operations when the device is on an electrical power source. The online phase generates final output with the minimal computational cost when the message (or ciphertext) and keywords become known. In addition, the proposed scheme R-OO-KASE also offers multi-keyword search capability and allows the data owners to revoke the delegated rights at any point in time, the two features are not supported in the existing schemes. The security analysis and empirical evaluations show that the proposed scheme is efficient to use in resource-constrained devices and provably secure as compared to the existing KASE schemes.","107831":"Recent years have witnessed a growing trend of utilizing reviews to improve the performance and interpretability of recommender systems. Almost all existing methods learn the latent representations from the user\u2019s and the item\u2019s historical reviews and then combine these two representations for rating prediction. The fatal limitation in these methods is that they are unable to utilize the most predictive review of the target user for the target item since such a review is not available at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation model, called AGTR, which can generate the unseen target review with adversarial training for rating prediction. To this end, we develop a unified framework to combine the rating tailored generative adversarial nets for synthetic review generation and the neural latent factor module using the generated target review along with historical reviews for rating prediction. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both rating prediction and review generation tasks.","108019":"Time difference of Arrival (TDOA)-based localization method, although used widely, calls for a fast and accurate solution owing to its time inefficiency and sensitivity to time delay estimation. In order to speed up the solution for nonlinear TDOA equations, while guaranteeing the location accuracy, this paper presents a hybrid approach namely multi-deep neural network model based on a virtual measurement method (MDNNM-VMM). Data consisting of multiple time difference values, resulting from a virtual measurement method (VMM), are fed to a pretrained multi-deep neural network model (MDNNM). These \u2018n\u2019 number of virtually generated sequences of time delays are obtained from a single set of TDOA equations, while conforming with a uniform distribution.

The optimized convolution neural network (CNN) is used to track the moving target in charge coupled device (CCD) camera system efficiently and accurately, and the melting behavior of SiO2 is described by coordinate translation transformation theory. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and delaunay triangulation were used to extract the characteristic parameters of the melting process of SiO2. The prediction model of the melting rate of SiO2 at high temperature was established by least square fitting (LSF) and dimensional analysis, and compared with the actual melting rate of SiO2 obtained by experiments. The results show that the melting characteristics of SiO2 at high temperature are in accordance with certain function rule. The performance of optimized CNN in terms of processing time and the accuracy are significantly improved, and the fusion rate prediction model of SiO2 is verified by 100% accuracy. It provides theoretical support and model basis for the improvement of slag cotton preparation technology.","108410":"Highly automated driving will be a novel experience for many users and may cause uncertainty and discomfort for them [1]. An efficient real-time detection of user uncertainty during automated driving may trigger adaptation strategies, which could enhance the driving experience and subsequently the acceptance of highly automated driving [2]. In this study, we compared three different models to classify a user\u2019s uncertainty regarding an automated vehicle\u2019s capabilities and traffic safety during overtaking maneuvers based on experimental data from a driving-simulator study. By combining physiological, contextual and user-specific data, we trained three different deep neural networks to classify user uncertainty during overtaking maneuvers on different sets of input features. We evaluated the models based on metrics like the classification accuracy and F1 Scores. For a purely context-based model, we used features such as the Time-Headway and Time-To-Collision of cars on the opposing lane. We demonstrate how the addition of user heart rate and related physiological features can improve the classification accuracy compared to a purely context-based uncertainty model. The third model included user-specific features to account for inter-user differences regarding uncertainty in highly automated vehicles. We argue that a combination of physiological, contextual and user-specific information is important for an effectual uncertainty detection that accounts for inter-user differences.","111786":"Camera calibration is a necessary preliminary step in computer vision for the estimation of the position of objects in the 3D world. Despite the intrinsic camera parameters can be easily computed offline, extrinsic parameters need to be computed each time a camera changes its position, thus not allowing for fast and dynamic network re-configuration. In this paper we present an unsupervised and automatic framework for the estimation of the extrinsic parameters of a camera network, which leverages on optimised 3D human mesh recovery from a single image, and which does not require the use of additional markers. We show how it is possible to retrieve the real-world position of the cameras in the network together with the floor plane, exploiting regular RGB images and with a weak prior knowledge of the internal parameters. Our framework can also work with a single camera and in real-time, allowing the user to add, re-position, or remove cameras from the network in a dynamic fashion.","113068":"Human beings may make random guesses in decision-making. Occasionally, their guesses may generate consistency with the real situation. This kind of consistency is termed random consistency. In the area of machine leaning, the randomness is unavoidable and ubiquitous in learning algorithms. However, the accuracy (A), which is a fundamental performance measure for machine learning, does not recognize the random consistency. This causes that the classifiers learnt by A contain the random consistency. The random consistency may cause an unreliable evaluation and harm the generalization performance. To solve this problem, the pure accuracy (PA) is defined to eliminate the random consistency from the A. In this paper, we mainly study the necessity, learning consistency and leaning method of the PA. We show that the PA is insensitive to the class distribution of classifier and is more fair to the majority and the minority than A. Subsequently, some novel generalization bounds on the PA and A are given. Furthermore, we show that the PA is Bayes-risk consistent in finite and infinite hypothesis space. We design a plug-in rule that maximizes the PA, and the experiments on twenty benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method performs statistically better than the kernel logistic regression in terms of PA and comparable performance in terms of A. Compared with the other plug-in rules, the proposed method obtains much better performance.","134713":"In the neoliberal environment of contemporary academia, an individual\u2019s research rankings and outputs can shape their career security and progression. When applying for ongoing employment and promotional opportunities, academics may benchmark their performance against that of superior colleagues to demonstrate their performance in relation to their discipline. The H-index and citation rates are commonly used to quantify the value of an academic\u2019s work, and they can be used comparatively for benchmarking purposes. The focus of this paper is to critically consider if Google Scholar be used for benchmarking against the professoriate in education, by weighting up issues of data reliability and participation. The Google Scholar profiles of full professors at top ranked universities in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America are analysed to explore how widespread Google Scholar use is in the education professoriate. Quartiles of impact are established in relation to H-index, with exploration of how gender is distributed across these quartiles. Limitations of using Google Scholar data are highlighted through a taxonomy of quality confounders, and the utility of Google Scholar as a legitimate tool for benchmarking against the professoriate in education is strongly challenged. As metrics continue to rise in their importance for academics\u2019 job security and promotional prospects, reliance on metrics of dubious quality and uneven participation must be questioned.","135163":"A core property of robust systems is given by the invariance of their function against the removal of some of their structural components. This intuition has been formalised in the context of input\u2013output maps, thereby introducing the notion of exclusion independence. We review work on how this formalisation allows us to derive characterisation theorems that provide a basis for the design of robust systems.","135164":"The federated identity model provides a solution for user authentication across multiple administrative domains. The academic federations, such as the Brazilian federation, are examples of this model in practice. The majority of institutions that participate in academic federations employ password-based authentication for their users, with an attacker only needing to find out one password in order to personify the user in all federated service providers. Multi-factor authentication emerges as a solution to increase the robustness of the authentication process. This article aims to introduce a comprehensive and open source solution to offer multi-factor authentication for Shibboleth Identity Providers. Based on the Multi-factor Authentication Profile standard, our solution provides three extra second factors (One-Time Password, FIDO2 and Phone Prompt). The solution has been deployed in the Brazilian academic federation, where it was evaluated using functional and integration testing, as well as security and case study analysis.","135326":"Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely associated with human diseases, and it is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases to get the relationships between lncRNAs and diseases. Due to the high costs and time complexity of traditional bio-experiments, in recent years, more and more computational methods have been proposed by researchers to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations. However, there exist all kinds of limitations in these state-of-the-art prediction methods as well. In this manuscript, a novel computational model named FVTLDA is proposed to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations. In FVTLDA, its major novelty lies in the integration of direct and indirect features related to lncRNA-disease associations such as the feature vectors of lncRNA-disease pairs and their corresponding association probability fractions, which guarantees that FVTLDA can be utilized to predict diseases without known related-lncRNAs and lncRNAs without known related-diseases. Moreover, FVTLDA neither relies solely on known lncRNA-disease nor requires any negative samples, which guarantee that it can infer potential lncRNA-disease associations more equitably and effectively than traditional state-of-the-art prediction methods. Additionally, to avoid the limitations of single model prediction techniques, we combine FVTLDA with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for data analysis respectively. Simulation experiment results show that FVTLDA with MLR can achieve reliable AUCs of 0.8909, 0.8936 and 0.8970 in 5-Fold Cross Validation (fivefold CV), 10-Fold Cross Validation (tenfold CV) and Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV), separately, while FVTLDA with ANN can achieve reliable AUCs of 0.8766, 0.8830 and 0.8807 in fivefold CV, tenfold CV, and LOOCV respectively. Furthermore, in case studies of gastric cancer, leukemia and lung cancer, experiment results show that there are 8, 8 and 8 out of top 10 candidate lncRNAs predicted by FVTLDA with MLR, and 8, 7 and 8 out of top 10 candidate lncRNAs predicted by FVTLDA with ANN, having been verified by recent literature. Comparing with the representative prediction model of KATZLDA, comparison results illustrate that FVTLDA with MLR and FVTLDA with ANN can achieve the average case study contrast scores of 0.8429 and 0.8515 respectively, which are both notably higher than the average case study contrast score of 0.6375 achieved by KATZLDA. The simulation results show that FVTLDA has good prediction performance, which is a good supplement to future bioinformatics research.","135327":"Due to the wide spread of 5G networks, network users have higher requirements for communication delays. Software-defined network is a new paradigm of decoupling the control logic from packet forwarding devices. We can reduce communication latency in the network by optimizing the location of the controller and improve the communication performance of the network. In this paper, the controller deployment problem of multi-network area is studied in order to reduce the average communication latency. In order to solve this problem, we proposed an optimized DPC algorithm. Specifically, on the basis of DPC algorithm we quoted the idea of triangular stability from the BeeDPC algorithm, and introduced SC measurement indicators, the degree of separation between sub-network regions and the degree of aggregation within the sub-network region, so as to divide the network region more reasonably. At the same time, we have break out of the constraints in the DPC algorithm and introduced closeness centrality to get a more reasonable placement scheme and reduced the limitations of the DPC algorithm. Simulation results have shown that the optimized DPC algorithm can effectively reduce the average delay between the control layer and the data layer, improve the network performance, and enhance network stability and reliability.","135492":"As the spectrum of X-ray procedures has increased both for diagnostic and for interventional cases, more attention is paid to X-ray dose management. While the medical benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of radiation injuries in almost all cases, reproducible studies on organ dose values help to plan preventive measures helping both patient as well as staff. Dose studies are either carried out retrospectively, experimentally using anthropomorphic phantoms, or computationally. When performed experimentally, it is helpful to combine them with simulations validating the measurements. In this paper, we show how such a dose simulation method, carried out together with actual X-ray experiments, can be realized to obtain reliable organ dose values efficiently. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was developed combining down-sampling and super-resolution techniques for accelerated processing accompanying X-ray dose measurements. The target volume is down-sampled using the statistical mode first. The estimated dose distribution is then up-sampled using guided filtering and the high-resolution target volume as guidance image. Second, we present a comparison of dose estimates calculated with our Monte Carlo code experimentally obtained values for an anthropomorphic phantom using metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor dosimeters. We reconstructed high-resolution dose distributions from coarse ones (down-sampling factor 2 to 16) with error rates ranging from 1.62 % to 4.91 %. Using down-sampled target volumes further reduced the computation time by 30 % to 60 %. Comparison of measured results to simulated dose values demonstrated high agreement with an average percentage error of under \n$$10 \\%$$\n\n for all measurement points. Our results indicate that Monte Carlo methods can be accelerated hardware-independently and still yield reliable results. This facilitates empirical dose studies that make use of online Monte Carlo simulations to easily cross-validate dose estimates on-site.","135493":"Traditional approaches to elucidation of protein structures by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) rely on distance restraints also known as Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). The use of NOEs as the primary source of structure determination by NMR spectroscopy is time consuming and expensive. Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) have become an alternate approach for structure calculation by NMR spectroscopy. In previous works, the software package REDCRAFT has been presented as a means of harnessing the information containing in RDCs for structure calculation of proteins. However, to meet its full potential, several improvements to REDCRAFT must be made. In this work, we present improvements to REDCRAFT that include increased usability, better interoperability, and a more robust core algorithm. We have demonstrated the impact of the improved core algorithm in the successful folding of the protein 1A1Z with as high as \u00b14\u2009Hz of added error. The REDCRAFT computed structure from the highly corrupted data exhibited less than 1.0\u2009\u00c5 with respect to the X-ray structure. We have also demonstrated the interoperability of REDCRAFT in a few instances including with PDBMine to reduce the amount of required data in successful folding of proteins to unprecedented levels. Here we have demonstrated the successful folding of the protein 1D3Z (to within 2.4\u2009\u00c5 of the X-ray structure) using only N-H RDCs from one alignment medium. The additional GUI features of REDCRAFT combined with the NEF compliance have significantly increased the flexibility and usability of this software package. The improvements of the core algorithm have substantially improved the robustness of REDCRAFT in utilizing less experimental data both in quality and quantity.","135494":"During design optimization, a smooth description of the geometry is important, especially for problems that are sensitive to the way interfaces are resolved, e.g., wave propagation or fluid-structure interaction. A level set description of the boundary, when combined with an enriched finite element formulation, offers a smoother description of the design than traditional density-based methods. However, existing enriched methods have drawbacks, including ill-conditioning and difficulties in prescribing essential boundary conditions. In this work, we introduce a new enriched topology optimization methodology that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks; boundaries are resolved accurately by means of the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IGFEM), coupled to a level set function constructed by radial basis functions. The enriched method used in this new approach to topology optimization has the same level of accuracy in the analysis as the standard finite element method with matching meshes, but without the need for remeshing. We derive the analytical sensitivities and we discuss the behavior of the optimization process in detail. We establish that IGFEM-based level set topology optimization generates correct topologies for well-known compliance minimization problems.","135495":"Alternative splicing isoforms have been reported as a new and robust class of diagnostic biomarkers. Over 95% of human genes are estimated to be alternatively spliced as a powerful means of producing functionally diverse proteins from a single gene. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies, especially RNA-seq, provides novel insights into large-scale detection and analysis of alternative splicing at the transcriptional level. Advances in Proteomic Technologies such as liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS\/MS), have shown tremendous power for the parallel characterization of large amount of proteins in biological samples. Although poor correspondence has been generally found from previous qualitative comparative analysis between proteomics and microarray data, significantly higher degrees of correlation have been observed at the level of exon. Combining protein and RNA data by searching LC\u2013MS\/MS data against a customized protein database from RNA-Seq may produce a subset of alternatively spliced protein isoform candidates that have higher confidence. We developed a bioinformatics workflow to discover alternative splicing biomarkers from LC\u2013MS\/MS using RNA-Seq. First, we retrieved high confident, novel alternative splicing biomarkers from the breast cancer RNA-Seq database. Then, we translated these sequences into in silico Isoform Junction Peptides, and created a customized alternative splicing database for MS searching. Lastly, we ran the Open Mass spectrometry Search Algorithm against the customized alternative splicing database with breast cancer plasma proteome. Twenty six alternative splicing biomarker peptides with one single intron event and one exon skipping event were identified. Further interpretation of biological pathways with our Integrated Pathway Analysis Database showed that these 26 peptides are associated with Cancer, Signaling, Metabolism, Regulation, Immune System and Hemostasis pathways, which are consistent with the 256 alternative splicing biomarkers from the RNA-Seq. This paper presents a bioinformatics workflow for using RNA-seq data to discover novel alternative splicing biomarkers from the breast cancer proteome. As a complement to synthetic alternative splicing database technique for alternative splicing identification, this method combines the advantages of two platforms: mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing and can help identify potentially highly sample-specific alternative splicing isoform biomarkers at early-stage of cancer.","135498":"Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the globe. Microbiological infections account for up to 20% of the total global cancer burden. The human microbiota within each organ system is distinct, and their compositional variation and interactions with the human host have been known to attribute detrimental and beneficial effects on tumor progression. With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, data generated from NGS is being used for pathogen detection in cancer. Numerous bioinformatics computational frameworks have been developed to study viral information from host-sequencing data and can be adapted to bacterial studies. This review highlights existing popular computational frameworks that utilize NGS data as input to decipher microbial composition, which output can predict functional compositional differences with clinically relevant applicability in the development of treatment and prevention strategies.","135499":"In real applications, environmental effects such as additive noise and room reverberation lead to a mismatch between training and testing signals that substantially reduces the performance of far-field speaker identification. As a solution to this mismatch problem, in this paper, a new binaural speaker identification system is proposed which employs the well-known equalization-cancelation technique in its structure. The equalization-cancelation algorithm is employed to enhance the input test speech and alleviate the detrimental effects of noise and reverberation in the speaker identification system. The performance of the proposed speaker identification system is compared with unprocessed identification systems and a traditional binaural speaker identification system from the literature. The proposed system is evaluated in both anechoic and reverberant conditions using different types of noise at various azimuthal positions. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method in all experimental conditions.","135539":"Owing to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically in machine learning, information technology (IT) systems can support humans in an increasing number of tasks. Yet, previous research indicates that people often prefer human support to support by an IT system, even if the latter provides superior performance \u2013 a phenomenon called algorithm aversion. A possible cause of algorithm aversion put forward in literature is that users lose trust in IT systems they become familiar with and perceive to err, for example, making forecasts that turn out to deviate from the actual value. Therefore, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of demonstrating an AI-based system\u2019s ability to learn as a potential countermeasure against algorithm aversion in an incentive-compatible online experiment. The experiment reveals how the nature of an erring advisor (i.e., human vs. algorithmic), its familiarity to the user (i.e., unfamiliar vs. familiar), and its ability to learn (i.e., non-learning vs. learning) influence a decision maker\u2019s reliance on the advisor\u2019s judgement for an objective and non-personal decision task. The results reveal no difference in the reliance on unfamiliar human and algorithmic advisors, but differences in the reliance on familiar human and algorithmic advisors that err. Demonstrating an advisor\u2019s ability to learn, however, offsets the effect of familiarity. Therefore, this study contributes to an enhanced understanding of algorithm aversion and is one of the first to examine how users perceive whether an IT system is able to learn. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications for the employment and design of AI-based systems.","135540":"High resolution 2D whole slide imaging provides rich information about the tissue structure. This information can be a lot richer if these 2D images can be stacked into a 3D tissue volume. A 3D analysis, however, requires accurate reconstruction of the tissue volume from the 2D image stack. This task is not trivial due to the distortions such as tissue tearing, folding and missing at each slide. Performing registration for the whole tissue slices may be adversely affected by distorted tissue regions. Consequently, regional registration is found to be more effective. In this paper, we propose a new approach to an accurate and robust registration of regions of interest for whole slide images. We introduce the idea of multi-scale attention for registration. Using mean similarity index as the metric, the proposed algorithm (mean \u00b1 SD \n$$0.84 \\pm 0.11$$\n\n) followed by a fine registration algorithm (\n$$0.86 \\pm 0.08$$\n\n) outperformed the state-of-the-art linear whole tissue registration algorithm (\n$$0.74 \\pm 0.19$$\n\n) and the regional version of this algorithm (\n$$0.81 \\pm 0.15$$\n\n). The proposed algorithm also outperforms the state-of-the-art nonlinear registration algorithm (original: \n$$0.82 \\pm 0.12$$\n\n, regional: \n$$0.77 \\pm 0.22$$\n\n) for whole slide images and a recently proposed patch-based registration algorithm (patch size 256: \n$$0.79 \\pm 0.16$$\n\n , patch size 512: \n$$0.77 \\pm 0.16$$\n\n) for medical images. Using multi-scale attention mechanism leads to a more robust and accurate solution to the problem of regional registration of whole slide images corrupted in some parts by major histological artifacts in the imaged tissue.","135763":"Neurodegenerative disorders are commonly characterized by atrophy of the brain which is caused by neuronal loss. Ventricles are one of the prominent structures in the brain; their shape changes, due to their content, the cerebrospinal fluid. Analyzing the morphological changes of ventricles, aids in the diagnosis of atrophy, for which the region of interest needs to be separated from the background. This study presents a modified distance regularized level set evolution segmentation method, incorporating regional intensity information. The proposed method is implemented for segmenting ventricles from brain images for normal and atrophy subjects of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography images. Results of the proposed method were compared with ground truth images and produced sensitivity in the range of 65%\u201390%, specificity in the range of 98%\u201399%, and accuracy in the range of 95%\u201398%. Peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity index were also used as performance measures for determining segmentation accuracy: 95% and 0.95, respectively. The parameters of level set formulation vary for different datasets. An optimization procedure was followed to fine tune parameters. The proposed method was found to be efficient and robust against noisy images. The proposed method is adaptive and multimodal.","135773":"Home telemonitoring is a promising approach to optimizing outcomes for patients with Type 2 Diabetes; however, this care strategy has not been adapted for use with understudied and underserved Hispanic\/Latinos (H\/L) patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\n A formative, Community-Based Participatory Research approach was used to adapt a home telemonitoring intervention to facilitate acceptability and feasibility for vulnerable H\/L patients. Utilizing the ADAPT-ITT framework, key stakeholders were engaged over an 8-month iterative process using a combination of strategies, including focus groups and structured interviews. Nine Community Advisory Board, Patient Advisory, and Provider Panel Committee focus group discussions were conducted, in English and Spanish, to garner stakeholder input before intervention implementation.\n Focus groups and structured interviews were also conducted with 12 patients enrolled in a 1-month pilot study, to obtain feedback from patients in the home to further adapt the intervention. Focus groups and structured interviews were approximately 2 hours and 30\u2009min, respectively. All focus groups and structured interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed. Structural coding was used to mark responses to topical questions in the moderator and interview guides. Two major themes emerged from qualitative analyses of Community Advisory Board\/subcommittee focus group data. The first major theme involved intervention components to maximize acceptance\/usability. Subthemes included tablet screens (e.g., privacy\/identity concerns; enlarging font sizes; lighter tablet to facilitate portability); cultural incongruence (e.g., language translation\/literacy, foods, actors \u201cwho look like me\u201d); nursing staff (e.g., ensuring accessibility; appointment flexibility); and, educational videos (e.g., the importance of information repetition). A second major theme involved suggested changes to the randomized control trial study structure to maximize participation, including a major restructuring of the consenting process and changes designed to optimize recruitment strategies. Themes from pilot participant focus group\/structured interviews were similar to those of the Community Advisory Board such as the need to address and simplify a burdensome consenting process, the importance of assuring privacy, and an accessible, culturally congruent nurse. These findings identify important adaptation recommendations from the stakeholder and potential user perspective that should be considered when implementing home telemonitoring for underserved patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

In this context, the reconstruction of the phylogeny representing the evolutionary history presents some peculiar aspects that depend on the technology used to obtain the data to analyze: Single Cell DNA Sequencing data have great specificity, but are affected by moderate false negative and missing value rates. Moreover, there has been some recent evidence of back mutations in cancer: this phenomenon is currently widely ignored.

We developed a new model based on the architecture of the semantic segmentation U-Net model to precisely segment mass lesions in MG images. The proposed end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) based model extracts contextual information by combining low-level and high-level features. We trained the proposed model using huge publicly available databases, (CBIS-DDSM, BCDR-01, and INbreast), and a private database from the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC). We compared the performance of the proposed model with those of the state-of-the-art DL models including the fully convolutional network (FCN), SegNet, Dilated-Net, original U-Net, and Faster R-CNN models and the conventional region growing (RG) method. The proposed Vanilla U-Net model outperforms the Faster R-CNN model significantly in terms of the runtime and the Intersection over Union metric (IOU). Training with digitized film-based and fully digitized MG images, the proposed Vanilla U-Net model achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.6%. The proposed model achieves a mean Dice coefficient index (DI) of 0.951 and a mean IOU of 0.909 that show how close the output segments are to the corresponding lesions in the ground truth maps. Data augmentation has been very effective in our experiments resulting in an increase in the mean DI and the mean IOU from 0.922 to 0.951 and 0.856 to 0.909, respectively. The proposed Vanilla U-Net based model can be used for precise segmentation of masses in MG images. This is because the segmentation process incorporates more multi-scale spatial context, and captures more local and global context to predict a precise pixel-wise segmentation map of an input full MG image. These detected maps can help radiologists in differentiating benign and malignant lesions depend on the lesion shapes. We show that using transfer learning, introducing augmentation, and modifying the architecture of the original model results in better performance in terms of the mean accuracy, the mean DI, and the mean IOU in detecting mass lesion compared to the other DL and the conventional models.","136354":"The Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance metric has been widely used in the biological science. It tries to identify the similar region of DNA,RNA and protein sequences by transforming one sequence to the another using the substitution, insertion, deletion and transposition operations. Lowrance and Wagner have developed an O(mn) time O(mn) space algorithm to find the minimum cost edit sequence between strings of length m and n, respectively. In our previous research, we have developed algorithms that run in O(mn) time using only O(s\u2217min{m,n}+m+n) space, where s is the size of the alphabet comprising the strings, to compute the DL distance as well as the corresponding edit sequence. These are so far the fastest and most space efficient algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the development of algorithms whose asymptotic space complexity is linear. We develop linear space algorithms to compute the Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance between two strings and determine the optimal trace (corresponding edit operations.)Extensive experiments conducted on three computational platforms\u2013Xeon E5 2603, I7-x980 and Xeon E5 2695\u2013show that, our algorithms, in addition to using less space, are much faster than earlier algorithms. Besides using less space than the previously known algorithms,significant run-time improvement was seen for our new algorithms on all three of our experimental platforms. On all platforms, our linear-space cache-efficient algorithms reduced run time by as much as 56.4% and 57.4% in respect to compute the DL distance and an optimal edit sequences compared to previous algorithms. Our multi-core algorithms reduced the run time by up to 59.3% compared to the best previously known multi-core algorithms.","136355":"Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input. Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated. Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available.

Given the challenges of managing the flows that cross an IXP, identifying elephant flows may help improve the quality of services provided to its participants. In this context, we leverage the new flexibility and resources of programmable data planes to identify elephant flows in IXP networks adaptively via the dynamic adjustment of thresholds. Our mechanism uses the information reported by the data plane to monitor network utilization in the control plane, calculating new thresholds based on previous flow sizes and durations percentiles and configuring them back into switches to support the local classification of flows. Thus, the thresholds are updated to make the identification process better aligned with the network behavior. The experimental results show that it is possible to identify and react to elephant flows quickly, less than 0.4ms, and efficiently, with only 98.4KB of data inserted into the network by the mechanism. In addition, the threshold updating mechanism achieved accuracy of up to 90% in our evaluation scenarios.","136600":"Cognitive radio is a technology developed for the effective use of radio spectrum sources. The spectrum sensing function plays a key role in the performance of cognitive radio networks. In this study, a new threshold determination method based on online learning algorithm is proposed to increase the spectrum sensing performance of spectrum sensing methods and to minimize the total error probability. The online learning algorithm looks for the optimum decision threshold, which is the most important parameter to decide the presence or absence of the primary user, using historical detection data. Energy detection- and matched filter-based spectrum sensing methods are discussed in detail. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested over non-fading and different fading channels for low signal-to-noise ratio regime with noise uncertainty. In the conclusion of the simulation studies, improvement in spectrum sensing performance according to optimal threshold selection was observed.","136685":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) represents nowadays in Europe the leading cause of non-traumatic disabilities in young adults, with more than 700,000 EU cases. Although huge strides have been made over the years, MS etiology remains partially unknown. Furthermore, the presence of various endogenous and exogenous factors can greatly influence the immune response of different individuals, making it difficult to study and understand the disease. This becomes more evident in a personalized-fashion when medical doctors have to choose the best therapy for patient well-being. In this optics, the use of stochastic models, capable of taking into consideration all the fluctuations due to unknown factors and individual variability, is highly advisable. We propose a new model to study the immune response in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS that is characterized by alternate episodes of symptom exacerbation (relapses) with periods of disease stability (remission). In this new model, both the peripheral lymph node\/blood vessel and the central nervous system are explicitly represented. The model was created and analysed using Epimod, our recently developed general framework for modeling complex biological systems. Then the effectiveness of our model was shown by modeling the complex immunological mechanisms characterizing RRMS during its course and under the DAC administration. Simulation results have proven the ability of the model to reproduce in silico the immune T cell balance characterizing RRMS course and the DAC effects. Furthermore, they confirmed the importance of a timely intervention on the disease course.","136687":"Knowledge is often produced from data generated in scientific investigations. An ever-growing number of scientific studies in several domains result into a massive amount of data, from which obtaining new knowledge requires computational help. For example, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, a life-threatening degenerative disease that is not yet curable. As the scientific community strives to better understand it and find a cure, great amounts of data have been generated, and new knowledge can be produced. A proper representation of such knowledge brings great benefits to researchers, to the scientific community, and consequently, to society. In this article, we study and evaluate a semi-automatic method that generates knowledge graphs (KGs) from biomedical texts in the scientific literature. Our solution explores natural language processing techniques with the aim of extracting and representing scientific literature knowledge encoded in KGs. Our method links entities and relations represented in KGs to concepts from existing biomedical ontologies available on the Web. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating KGs from unstructured texts obtained from a set of abstracts taken from scientific papers on the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. We involve physicians to compare our extracted triples from their manual extraction via their analysis of the abstracts. The evaluation further concerned a qualitative analysis by the physicians of the generated KGs with our software tool. The experimental results indicate the quality of the generated KGs. The proposed method extracts a great amount of triples, showing the effectiveness of our rule-based method employed in the identification of relations in texts. In addition, ontology links are successfully obtained, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the ontology linking method proposed in this investigation. We demonstrate that our proposal is effective on building ontology-linked KGs representing the knowledge obtained from biomedical scientific texts. Such representation can add value to the research in various domains, enabling researchers to compare the occurrence of concepts from different studies. The KGs generated may pave the way to potential proposal of new theories based on data analysis to advance the state of the art in their research domains.","136688":"To reduce cancer mortality and improve cancer outcomes, it is critical to understand the various cancer risk factors (RFs) across different domains (e.g., genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors) and levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, and community levels). However, prior research on RFs of cancer outcomes, has primarily focused on individual level RFs due to the lack of integrated datasets that contain multi-level, multi-domain RFs. Further, the lack of a consensus and proper guidance on systematically identify RFs also increase the difficulty of RF selection from heterogenous data sources in a multi-level integrative data analysis (mIDA) study. More importantly, as mIDA studies require integrating heterogenous data sources, the data integration processes in the limited number of existing mIDA studies are inconsistently performed and poorly documented, and thus threatening transparency and reproducibility. Informed by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) research framework, we (1) reviewed existing reporting guidelines from the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network and (2) developed a theory-driven reporting guideline to guide the RF variable selection, data source selection, and data integration process. Then, we developed an ontology to standardize the documentation of the RF selection and data integration process in mIDA studies. We summarized the review results and created a reporting guideline\u2014ATTEST\u2014for reporting the variable selection and data source selection and integration process. We provided an ATTEST check list to help researchers to annotate and clearly document each step of their mIDA studies to ensure the transparency and reproducibility. We used the ATTEST to report two mIDA case studies and further transformed annotation results into sematic triples, so that the relationships among variables, data sources and integration processes are explicitly standardized and modeled using the classes and properties from OD-ATTEST. Our ontology-based reporting guideline solves some key challenges in current mIDA studies for cancer outcomes research, through providing (1) a theory-driven guidance for multi-level and multi-domain RF variable and data source selection; and (2) a standardized documentation of the data selection and integration processes powered by an ontology, thus a way to enable sharing of mIDA study reports among researchers.","136689":"Leveraging graphs for machine learning tasks can result in more expressive power as extra information is added to the data by explicitly encoding relations between entities. Knowledge graphs are multi-relational, directed graph representations of domain knowledge. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have been gaining a lot of popularity. They can directly process these type of graphs or learn a low-dimensional numerical representation. While it has been shown empirically that these techniques achieve excellent predictive performances, they lack interpretability. This is of vital importance in applications situated in critical domains, such as health care. We present a technique that mines interpretable walks from knowledge graphs that are very informative for a certain classification problem. The walks themselves are of a specific format to allow for the creation of data structures that result in very efficient mining. We combine this mining algorithm with three different approaches in order to classify nodes within a graph. Each of these approaches excels on different dimensions such as explainability, predictive performance and computational runtime. We compare our techniques to well-known state-of-the-art black-box alternatives on four benchmark knowledge graph data sets. Results show that our three presented approaches in combination with the proposed mining algorithm are at least competitive to the black-box alternatives, even often outperforming them, while being interpretable. The mining of walks is an interesting alternative for node classification in knowledge graphs. Opposed to the current state-of-the-art that uses deep learning techniques, it results in inherently interpretable or transparent models without a sacrifice in terms of predictive performance.","136690":"Emotions after surviving cancer can be complicated. The survivors may have gained new strength to continue life, but some of them may begin to deal with complicated feelings and emotional stress due to trauma and fear of cancer recurrence. The widespread use of Twitter for socializing has been the alternative medium for data collection compared to traditional studies of mental health, which primarily depend on information taken from medical staff with their consent. These social media data, to a certain extent, reflect the users\u2019 psychological state. However, Twitter also contains a mix of noisy and genuine tweets. The process of manually identifying genuine tweets is expensive and time-consuming. We stream the data using cancer as a keyword to filter the tweets with cancer-free and use post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related keywords to reduce the time spent on the annotation task. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learns the representations of the input to identify cancer survivors with PTSD. The results present that the proposed CNN can effectively identify cancer survivors with PTSD. The experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the baselines and correctly classifies the new tweets. PTSD is one of the severe anxiety disorders that could affect individuals who are exposed to traumatic events, including cancer. Cancer survivors are at risk of short-term or long-term effects on physical and psycho-social well-being. Therefore, the evaluation and treatment of PTSD are essential parts of cancer survivorship care. It will act as an alarming system by detecting the PTSD presence based on users\u2019 postings on Twitter.","136691":"The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein I (PD-1) has been identified as a key target in immunotherapy. PD-1 reduces the risk of autoimmunity by inducing apoptosis in antigen-specific T cells upon interaction with programmed cell death protein ligand I (PD-L1). Various cancer types overexpress PD-L1 to evade the immune system by inducing apoptosis in tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. The clinically used blocking antibody nivolumab binds to PD-1 and inhibits the immunosuppressive interaction with PD-L1. Even though PD-1 is already used as a drug target, the exact mechanism of the receptor is still a matter of debate. For instance, it is hypothesized that the signal transduction is based on an active conformation of PD-1. Here we present the results of the first molecular dynamics simulations of PD-1 with a complete extracellular domain with a focus on the role of the BC-loop of PD-1 upon binding PD-L1 or nivolumab. We could demonstrate that the BC-loop can form three conformations. Nivolumab binds to the BC-loop according to the conformational selection model whereas PD-L1 induces allosterically a conformational change of the BC-loop. Due to the structural differences of the BC-loop, a signal transduction based on active conformation cannot be ruled out. These findings will have an impact on drug design and will help to refine immunotherapy blocking antibodies.","136692":"SARS-CoV-2 is a severe respiratory infection that infects humans. Its outburst entitled it as a pandemic emergence. To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. We present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2. In silico trials are showing to be powerful weapons in predicting immune responses of potential candidate vaccines. Here, UISS has been extended to be used as an in silico trial platform to speed-up and drive the discovery pipeline of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","136693":"Previously, we introduced our Patient Health Information Dialogue Ontology (PHIDO) that manages the dialogue and contextual information of the session between an agent and a health consumer. In this study, we take the next step and introduce the Conversational Ontology Operator (COO), the software engine harnessing PHIDO. We also developed a question-answering subsystem called Frankenstein Ontology Question-Answering for User-centric Systems (FOQUS) to support the dialogue interaction. We tested both the dialogue engine and the question-answering system using application-based competency questions and questions furnished from our previous Wizard of OZ simulation trials. Our results revealed that the dialogue engine is able to perform the core tasks of communicating health information and conversational flow. Inter-rater agreement and accuracy scores among four reviewers indicated perceived, acceptable responses to the questions asked by participants from the simulation studies, yet the composition of the responses was deemed mediocre by our evaluators. Overall, we present some preliminary evidence of a functioning ontology-based system to manage dialogue and consumer questions. Future plans for this work will involve deploying this system in a speech-enabled agent to assess its usage with potential health consumer users.","136694":"In 2018, about 10 million people were found infected by tuberculosis, with approximately 1.2 million deaths worldwide. Despite these numbers have been relatively stable in recent years, tuberculosis is still considered one of the top 10 deadliest diseases worldwide. Over the years, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has developed a form of resistance to first-line tuberculosis treatments, specifically to isoniazid, leading to multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this context, the EU and Indian DBT funded project STriTuVaD\u2014In Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Development\u2014is supporting the identification of new interventional strategies against tuberculosis thanks to the use of Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS), a computational framework capable of predicting the immunity induced by specific drugs such as therapeutic vaccines and antibiotics. Here, we present how UISS accurately simulates tuberculosis dynamics and its interaction within the immune system, and how it predicts the efficacy of the combined action of isoniazid and RUTI vaccine in a specific digital population cohort. Specifically, we simulated two groups of 100 digital patients. The first group was treated with isoniazid only, while the second one was treated with the combination of RUTI vaccine and isoniazid, according to the dosage strategy described in the clinical trial design. UISS-TB shows to be in good agreement with clinical trial results suggesting that RUTI vaccine may favor a partial recover of infected lung tissue. In silico trials innovations represent a powerful pipeline for the prediction of the effects of specific therapeutic strategies and related clinical outcomes. Here, we present a further step in UISS framework implementation. Specifically, we found that the simulated mechanism of action of RUTI and INH are in good alignment with the results coming from past clinical phase IIa trials.","136695":"The STriTuVaD project, funded by Horizon 2020, aims to test through a Phase IIb clinical trial one of the most advanced therapeutic vaccines against tuberculosis. As part of this initiative, we have developed a strategy for generating in silico patients consistent with target population characteristics, which can then be used in combination with in vivo data on an augmented clinical trial. One of the most challenging tasks for using virtual patients is developing a methodology to reproduce biological diversity of the target population, ie, providing an appropriate strategy for generating libraries of digital patients. This has been achieved through the creation of the initial immune system repertoire in a stochastic way, and through the identification of a vector of features that combines both biological and pathophysiological parameters that personalise the digital patient to reproduce the physiology and the pathophysiology of the subject. We propose a sequential approach to sampling from the joint features population distribution in order to create a cohort of virtual patients with some specific characteristics, resembling the recruitment process for the target clinical trial, which then can be used for augmenting the information from the physical the trial to help reduce its size and duration.","136696":"Treatment effect prediction (TEP) plays an important role in disease management by ensuring that the expected clinical outcomes are obtained after performing specialized and sophisticated treatments on patients given their personalized clinical status. In recent years, the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has provided a comprehensive data source for intelligent clinical applications including the TEP investigated in this study. We examined the problem of using a large volume of heterogeneous EHR data to predict treatment effects and developed an adversarial deep treatment effect prediction model to address the problem. Our model employed two auto-encoders for learning the representative and discriminative features of both patient characteristics and treatments from EHR data. The discriminative power of the learned features was further enhanced by decoding the correlational information between the patient characteristics and subsequent treatments by means of a generated adversarial learning strategy. Thereafter, a logistic regression layer was appended on the top of the resulting feature representation layer for TEP. The proposed model was evaluated on two real clinical datasets collected from the cardiology department of a Chinese hospital. In particular, on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dataset, the proposed adversarial deep treatment effect prediction (ADTEP) (0.662) exhibited 1.4, 2.2, and 6.3% performance gains in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) over deep treatment effect prediction (DTEP) (0.653), logistic regression (LR) (0.648), and support vector machine (SVM) (0.621), respectively. As for heart failure (HF) case study, the proposed ADTEP also outperformed all benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model achieved competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in tackling the TEP problem. In this work, we propose a novel model to address the TEP problem by utilizing a large volume of observational data from EHR. With adversarial learning strategy, our proposed model can further explore the correlational information between patient statuses and treatments to extract more robust and discriminative representation of patient samples from their EHR data. Such representation finally benefits the model on TEP. The experimental results of two case studies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.","136697":"Prediction of patient outcome in medical intensive care units (ICU) may help for development and investigation of early interventional strategies. Several ICU scoring systems have been developed and are used to predict clinical outcome of ICU patients. These scores are calculated from clinical physiological and biochemical characteristics of patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a correlate of cardiac autonomic regulation and has been evident as a marker of poor clinical prognosis. HRV can be measured from the electrocardiogram non-invasively and monitored in real time. HRV has been identified as a promising \u2018electronic biomarker\u2019 of disease severity. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a subset of critically ill patients admitted to ICU, with significant morbidity and mortality, and often difficult to predict outcomes. Changes of HRV for brain injured patients have been reported in several studies. This study aimed to utilize the continuous HRV collection from admission across the first 24\u00a0h in the ICU in severe TBI patients to develop a patient outcome prediction system. A feature extraction strategy was applied to measure the HRV fluctuation during time. A prediction model was developed based on HRV measures with\u00a0a genetic algorithm for feature selection. The result (AUC: 0.77) was compared with earlier reported scoring systems (highest AUC: 0.76), encouraging further development and practical application. The prediction models built with different feature sets indicated that HRV based parameters may help predict brain injury patient outcome better than the previously adopted illness severity scores.","136699":"We previously introduced PCPS (Proteasome Cleavage Prediction Server), a web-based tool to predict proteasome cleavage sites using n-grams. Here, we evaluated the ability of PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes. We first assembled an epitope dataset consisting of 844 unique virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes and their source proteins. We then analyzed cleavage predictions by PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model on this dataset and compared them with those provided by a related method implemented by NetChop web server. PCPS was clearly superior to NetChop in term of sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.79) but somewhat inferior with regard to specificity (0.55 vs. 0.60). Judging by the Mathew\u2019s Correlation Coefficient, PCPS predictions were overall superior to those provided by NetChop (0.46 vs. 0.39). We next analyzed the power of C-terminal cleavage predictions provided by the same PCPS model to discriminate CD8+ T\u00a0cell epitopes, finding that they could be discriminated from random peptides with an accuracy of 0.74. Following these results, we tuned the PCPS web server to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes and predicted the entire SARS-CoV-2 epitope space. We report an improved version of PCPS named iPCPS for predicting proteasome cleavage sites and peptides with CD8+ T cell epitope features. iPCPS is available for free public use at \n                  https:\/\/imed.med.ucm.es\/Tools\/pcps\/\n                  \n                .","136700":"The aim of a recent research project was the investigation of the mechanisms involved in the onset of type 2 diabetes in the absence of familiarity. This has led to the development of a computational model that recapitulates the aetiology of the disease and simulates the immunological and metabolic alterations linked to type-2 diabetes subjected to clinical, physiological, and behavioural features of prototypical human individuals. We analysed the time course of 46,170 virtual subjects, experiencing different lifestyle conditions. We then set up a statistical model able to recapitulate the simulated outcomes. The resulting machine learning model adequately predicts the synthetic dataset and can, therefore, be used as a computationally-cheaper version of the detailed mathematical model, ready to be implemented on mobile devices to allow self-assessment by informed and aware individuals.\n The computational model used to generate the dataset of this work is available as a web-service at the following address: \n                  http:\/\/kraken.iac.rm.cnr.it\/T2DM\n                  \n                .","136701":"Semantic web technology has been applied widely in the biomedical informatics field. Large numbers of biomedical datasets are available online in the resource description framework (RDF) format. Semantic relationship mining among genes, disorders, and drugs is widely used in, for example, precision medicine and drug repositioning. However, most of the existing studies focused on a single dataset. It is not easy to find the most current relationships among disorder-gene-drug relationships since the relationships are distributed in heterogeneous datasets. How to mine their semantic relationships from different biomedical datasets is an important issue. First, a variety of biomedical datasets were converted into RDF triple data; then, multisource biomedical datasets were integrated into a storage system using a data integration algorithm. Second, nine query patterns among genes, disorders, and drugs from different biomedical datasets were designed. Third, the gene-disorder-drug semantic relationship mining algorithm is presented. This algorithm can query the relationships among various entities from different datasets. We focused on mining the putative and the most current disorder-gene-drug relationships about Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The results demonstrate that our method has significant advantages in mining and integrating multisource heterogeneous biomedical datasets. Twenty-five new relationships among the genes, disorders, and drugs were mined from four different datasets. The query results showed that most of them came from different datasets. The precision of the method increased by 2.51% compared to that of the multisource linked open data fusion method presented in the 4th International Workshop on Semantics-Powered Data Mining and Analytics (SEPDA 2019). Moreover, the number of query results increased by 7.7%, and the number of correct queries increased by 9.5%.","136702":"An effective yellow fever (YF) vaccine has been available since 1937. Nevertheless, questions regarding its use remain poorly understood, such as the ideal dose to confer immunity against the disease, the need for a booster dose, the optimal immunisation schedule for immunocompetent, immunosuppressed, and pediatric populations, among other issues. This work aims to demonstrate that computational tools can be used to simulate different scenarios regarding YF vaccination and the immune response of individuals to this vaccine, thus assisting the response of some of these open questions. This work presents the computational results obtained by a mathematical model of the human immune response to vaccination against YF. Five scenarios were simulated: primovaccination in adults and children, booster dose in adult individuals, vaccination of individuals with autoimmune diseases under immunomodulatory therapy, and the immune response to different vaccine doses. Where data were available, the model was able to quantitatively replicate the levels of antibodies obtained experimentally. In addition, for those scenarios where data were not available, it was possible to qualitatively reproduce the immune response behaviours described in the literature. Our simulations show that the minimum dose to confer immunity against YF is half of the reference dose. The results also suggest that immunological immaturity in children limits the induction and persistence of long-lived plasma cells are related to the antibody decay observed experimentally. Finally, the decay observed in the antibody level after ten years suggests that a booster dose is necessary to keep immunity against YF.","139499":"We present a method to recover the 3D flying shape of a sail using passive markers. In the navigation and naval architecture domain, retrieving the sail shape may be of immense value to confirm or contest simulation results, and to aid the design of new optimal sails. Our acquisition setup is very simple and low-cost, as it is only necessary to fix a series of printable markers on the sail and register the flying shape in real sailing conditions from a side vessel with a single camera. We reconstruct the average sail shape during an interval where the sailor maintains the sail as stable as possible. The average is further improved by a Bundle Adjustment algorithm. We tested our method in a real sailing scenario and present promising results. Quantitatively, we show the precision in regards to the reconstructed markers area and the reprojected points. Qualitatively, we present feedback from domain experts who evaluated our results and confirmed the usefulness and quality of the reconstructed shape.","148253":"The facility layout problem is concerned with finding an arrangement of non-overlapping indivisible departments within a facility so as to minimize the total expected flow cost. In this paper we consider the special case of multi-row layout in which all the departments are to be placed in three or more rows, and our focus is on, for the first time, solutions for large instances. We first propose a new mixed integer linear programming formulation that uses continuous variables to represent the departments\u2019 location in both x and y coordinates, where x represents the position of a department within a row and y represents the row assigned to the department. We prove that this formulation always achieves an optimal solution with integer values of y, but it is limited to solving instances with up to 13 departments. This limitation motivates the application of a two-stage optimization algorithm that combines two mathematical optimization models by taking the output of the first-stage model as the input of the second-stage model. This algorithm is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one in the literature reporting solutions for instances with up to 100 departments.","151516":"The outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring is a family of predictive process mining techniques that have witnessed rapid development and increasing adoption in the past few years. Boosted by the recent successful applications of deep learning in predictive process mining, we propose  ORANGE , a novel deep learning method for learning outcome-oriented predictive process models. The main innovation of this study is that we adopt an imagery representation of the ongoing traces, which delineates potential data patterns that arise at neighbour pixels. Leveraging a collection of images representing ongoing traces, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the outcome of an ongoing trace. The empirical study shows the feasibility of the proposed method by investigating its accuracy on different benchmark outcome prediction problems in comparison to state-of-art competitor methods. In addition, we show how  ORANGE  can be integrated as an Intelligent Assistant into a CVM realized by MTM Project srl company to support sales agents in their negotiations. This case study shows that  ORANGE  can be effectively used to smartly monitor the outcome of ongoing negotiations by early highlighting negotiations that are candidate to be completed successfully.","215512":"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms rely on carefully designed environment rewards that are extrinsic to the agent. However, in many real-world scenarios rewards are sparse or delayed, motivating the need for discovering efficient exploration strategies. While intrinsically motivated agents hold promise of better local exploration, solving problems that require coordinated decisions over long-time horizons remains an open problem. We postulate that to discover such strategies, a DRL agent should be able to combine local and high-level exploration behaviors. To this end, we introduce the concept of fast and slow curiosity that aims to incentivize long-time horizon exploration. Our method decomposes the curiosity bonus into a fast reward that deals with local exploration and a slow reward that encourages global exploration. We formulate this bonus as the error in an agent\u2019s ability to reconstruct the observations given their contexts. We further propose to dynamically weight local and high-level strategies by measuring state diversity. We evaluate our method on a variety of benchmark environments, including Minigrid, Super Mario Bros, and Atari games. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms prior approaches in most tasks in terms of exploration efficiency and mean scores.","220272":"Cooperation and coordination are major issues in studies on multi-agent systems because the entire performance of such systems is greatly affected by these activities. The issues are challenging however, because appropriate coordinated behaviors depend on not only environmental characteristics but also other agents\u2019 strategies. On the other hand, advances in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) have recently attracted attention, because MADRL can considerably improve the entire performance of multi-agent systems in certain domains. The characteristics of learned coordination structures and agent\u2019s resulting behaviors, however, have not been clarified sufficiently. Therefore, we focus here on MADRL in which agents have their own deep Q-networks (DQNs), and we analyze their coordinated behaviors and structures for the pickup and floor laying problem, which is an abstraction of our target application. In particular, we analyze the behaviors around scarce resources and long narrow passages in which conflicts such as collisions are likely to occur. We then indicated that different types of inputs to the networks exhibit similar performance but generate various coordination structures with associated behaviors, such as division of labor and a shared social norm, with no direct communication.","247865":"Word mismatch between queries and documents is a long-standing challenge in information retrieval. Recent advances in distributed word representations address the word mismatch problem by enabling semantic matching. However, most existing models rank documents based on semantic matching between query and document terms without an explicit understanding of the relationship of the match to relevance. To consider semantic matching between query and document, we propose an unsupervised semantic matching model by simulating a user who makes relevance decisions. The primary goal of the proposed model is to combine the exact and semantic matching between query and document terms, which has been shown to produce effective performance in information retrieval. As semantic matching between queries and entire documents is computationally expensive, we propose to use local contexts of query terms in documents for semantic matching. Matching with smaller query-related contexts of documents stems from the relevance judgment process recorded by human observers. The most relevant part of a document is then recognized and used to rank documents with respect to the query. Experimental results on several representative retrieval models and standard datasets show that our proposed semantic matching model significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all measures.","285411":"The recent success of implicit neural scene representations has presented a viable new method for how we capture and store 3D scenes. Unlike conventional 3D representations, such as point clouds, which explicitly store scene properties in discrete, localized units, these implicit representations encode a scene in the weights of a neural network which can be queried at any coordinate to produce these same scene properties. Thus far, implicit representations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearance and\/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step and demonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) [67] is actually multi-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semantic segmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry. To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learning strategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method is simple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masks in order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation. We explore two novel applications for this semantically aware implicit neural scene representation: 3D novel view and semantic label synthesis given only a single input RGB image or 2D label mask, as well as 3D interpolation of appearance and semantics.","285413":"In this paper we demonstrate that global photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) over all past keyframes can significantly improve the global accuracy of a monocular SLAM map compared to geometric techniques such as pose-graph optimization or traditional (geometric) bundle adjustment. However, PBA is computationally expensive in runtime, and memory usage can be prohibitively high. In order to address this scalability issue, we formulate PBA as an approximate consensus program. Due to its decomposable structure, the problem can be solved with block coordinate descent in parallel across multiple independent workers, each having lower requirements on memory and computational resources. For improved accuracy and convergence, we propose a novel gauge aware consensus update. Our experiments on real-world data show an average error reduction of 62% compared to odometry and 33% compared to intermediate pose-graph optimization, and that compared to the central optimization on a single machine, our distributed PBA achieves competitive pose-accuracy and cost.","285414":"We propose to use Simulated Annealing to solve the correspondence problem between near-isometric 3D shapes. Our method gains efficiency through quickly upsampling a sparse correspondence by minimizing the embedding error of new samples on the surfaces and applying simulated annealing to refine the result. The algorithm alternates between sampling additional points on the surface and swapping points within the current solution according to Simulated Annealing theory. Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic method and less prone to get stuck in local extrema which allows us to obtain good results on the NPhard quadratic assignment problem} (QAP). Our method can be used as a stand-alone correspondence pipeline through an initial seed generator as well as to densify a set of sparse input matches. Furthermore, the use of locality sensitive hashing to approximate geodesic distances reduces the computational complexity and memory consumption significantly. This allows our algorithm to run on meshes with over 100k points, an accomplishment that few approaches tackling the QAP directly achieve. We show convincing results on datasets like TOSCA and SHREC\u201919 Connecitvity.","285420":"Face models built from 3D face databases are often used in computer vision and graphics tasks such as face reconstruction, replacement, tracking and manipulation. For such tasks, commonly used multi-linear morphable models, which provide semantic control over facial identity and expression, often lack quality and expressivity due to their linear nature. Deep neural networks offer the possibility of non-linear face modeling, where so far most research has focused on generating realistic facial images with less focus on 3D geometry, and methods that do produce geometry have little or no notion of semantic control, thereby limiting their artistic applicability. We present a method for nonlinear 3D face modeling using neural architectures that provides intuitive semantic control over both identity and expression by disentangling these dimensions from each other, essentially combining the benefits of both multi-linear face models and nonlinear deep face networks. The result is a powerful, semantically controllable, nonlinear, parametric face model. We demonstrate the value of our semantic deep face model with applications of 3D face synthesis, facial performance transfer, performance editing, and 2D landmark-based performance retargeting.","285510":"Surface reconstruction from point clouds has been a well-studied research topic with applications in computer vision and computer graphics. Recently, several learningbased methods were proposed for 3D shape representation through implicit functions which among others can be used for point cloud-based reconstruction. Although delivering compelling results for synthetic object datasets of overseeable size, they fail to represent larger scenes accurately, presumably due to the use of only one global latent code for encoding an entire scene or object. We propose to encode only parts of objects with features attached to unstructured point clouds. To this end we use a hierarchical feature map in 3D space, extracted from the input point clouds, with which local latent shape encodings can be queried at arbitrary positions. We use a permutohedral lattice to process the hierarchical feature maps sparsely and efficiently. This enables accurate and detailed point cloud-based reconstructions for large amounts of points in a time-efficient manner, showing good generalization capabilities across different datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the reconstruction capability of our method and compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.","285511":"Decomposing scenes into reflectance and lighting is an important task for applications such as relighting, image matching or content creation. Advanced light transport effects like occlusion and indirect lighting are often ignored, leading to subpar decompositions in which the albedo needs to compensate for insufficiencies in the estimated shading. We show how to account for these advanced lighting effects by utilizing precomputed radiance transfer to estimate reflectance and lighting. Given the geometry of an object and one or multiple images, our method reconstructs the object\u2019s surface reflectance properties\u2014such as its albedo and glossiness\u2014as well as a colored lighting environment map. Evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that incorporation of indirect light leads to qualitatively and quantitatively improved results.","285512":"Recent progress in consumer hardware allowed for the collection of a large amount of animated point cloud data, which is on the one hand highly redundant and on the other hand incomplete. Our goal is to bridge this gap and find a low dimensional representation capable of approximation to a desired precision and completion of missing data. Model-less non-rigid 3D reconstruction algorithms, formulated as a linear factorization of observed point tracks into static shape component and dynamic pose, have been found insufficient to create suitable generative models, capable of generating new unobserved poses. This is due to the non-locality of the linear models, over-fitting to the non-causal correlations present in the data, which manifests in the reconstruction containing rigidly behaving not directly connected parts. In this paper, we propose a new method that can distinguish body parts and factorize the data into shape and pose purely using topological properties of the manifold-local deformations and neighborhoods. To obtain localized factorization, we formulate the deformation distance between two point tracks as the smallest deformation along the path between them. After embedding such distance in low dimensional space, a clustering of embedded data leads to close to rigid components, suitable as initialization for fitting a model-a skinned rigged mesh, used extensively in computer graphics. As both local deformations and neighborhoods of a point are local and can be estimated only from the part of the animation, the method can be used to recover unobserved data in each frame.","285514":"Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers more and more challenge the notion of technologies as objects and humans as subjects. This conceptualisation has led to various approaches inquiring into object perspectives within HCI. Even though the development and analysis of games and players is filled with notions of intersubjectivity, games research has yet to embrace an object-oriented perspective. Through an analysis of existing methods, we show how Object-Oriented Inquiry offers a useful, playful and speculative lens to proactively engage with and reflect on how we might know what it is like to be a game. We illustrate how to actively attend to a game\u2019s perspective as a valid position. This has the potential to not only sharpen our understanding of implicit affordances but, in turn, about our assumptions regarding play and games more generally.In a series of case studies, we apply several object-oriented methods across three methodological explorations on becoming, being and acting as a game, and illustrate their usefulness for generating meaningful insights for game design and evaluation. Our work contributes to emerging object-oriented practices that acknowledge the agency of technologies within HCI at large and its games-oriented strand in particular.","291395":"Within recent years, Continuous-Time Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (CTSLAM) formalisms have become subject to increased attention from the scientific community due to their vast potential in facilitating motion corrected feature reprojection and direct unsynchronized multi-rate sensor fusion.

Most work to solve this problem ignores image matches that are inconsistent according to the statistics of the tracks graph, but these methods often need to be tuned for each dataset and can lead to reduced completeness of normally good reconstructions when valid matches are removed. Our key idea is to address ambiguity directly in the reconstruction process by using only a subset of reliable matches to determine resectioning order and the initial pose. We also introduce a new measure of similarity that adjusts the influence of feature matches based on their track length. We show this improves reconstruction robustness for two state-of-the-art SfM algorithms on many diverse datasets.","291456":"High fidelity digital 3D environments have been proposed in recent years, however, it remains extremely challenging to automatically equip such environment with realistic human bodies. Existing work utilizes images, depth or semantic maps to represent the scene, and parametric human models to represent 3D bodies. While being straightforward, their generated human-scene interactions are often lack of naturalness and physical plausibility. Our key observation is that humans interact with the world through body-scene contact. To synthesize realistic human-scene interactions, it is essential to effectively represent the physical contact and proximity between the body and the world. To that end, we propose a novel interaction generation method, named PLACE (Proximity Learning of Articulation and Contact in 3D Environments), which explicitly models the proximity between the human body and the 3D scene around it. Specifically, given a set of basis points on a scene mesh, we leverage a conditional variational autoencoder to synthesize the minimum distances from the basis points to the human body surface. The generated proximal relationship exhibits which region of the scene is in contact with the person. Furthermore, based on such synthesized proximity, we are able to effectively obtain expressive 3D human bodies that interact with the 3D scene naturally. Our perceptual study shows that PLACE significantly improves the state-of-the-art method, approaching the realism of real human-scene interaction. We believe our method makes an important step towards the fully automatic synthesis of realistic 3D human bodies in 3D scenes. The code and model are available for research at https:\/\/sanweiliti. github.io\/PLACE\/PLACE.html.","291460":"While dense non-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM) has been extensively studied from the perspective of the reconstructability problem over the recent years, almost no attempts have been undertaken to bring it into the practical realm. The reasons for the slow dissemination are the severe ill-posedness, high sensitivity to motion and deformation cues, and the difficulty to obtain reliable point tracks in the vast majority of practical scenarios.To fill this gap, we propose a new framework that first extracts prior knowledge from an input image sequence with NRSfM. Our Dynamic Shape Prior Reconstruction (DSPR) approach then uses the obtained 3D reconstructions as a dynamic shape prior for sequential surface recovery in scenarios with recurrence. DSPR can be combined with existing dense NRSfM techniques while its energy functional is optimised with multi-start gradient descent at real-time frame rates for new incoming point tracks. The proposed versatile framework with a new core NRSfM approach outperforms several other methods in the ability to handle inaccurate and noisy point tracks, provided we have access to a representative (in terms of the deformation variety) image sequence. Comprehensive experiments highlight convergence properties and the accuracy of DSPR under different disturbing effects. We also perform a joint study of tracking and reconstruction and show applications to shape compression and heart reconstruction under occlusions. We achieve state-of-the-art metrics (accuracy and compression ratios) in different scenarios.","291464":"We introduce a large-scale annotated mechanical components benchmark for classification and retrieval tasks named Mechanical Components Benchmark (MCB): a large-scale dataset of 3D objects of mechanical components. The dataset enables data-driven feature learning for mechanical components. Exploring the shape descriptor for mechanical components is essential to computer vision and manufacturing applications. However, not much attention has been given on creating annotated mechanical components datasets on a large scale. This is because acquiring 3D models is challenging and annotating mechanical components requires engineering knowledge. Our main contributions are the creation of a large-scale annotated mechanical component benchmark, defining hierarchy taxonomy of mechanical components, and benchmarking the effectiveness of deep learning shape classifiers on the mechanical components. We created an annotated dataset and benchmarked seven state-of-the-art deep learning classification methods in three categories, namely: (1) point clouds, (2) volumetric representation in voxel grids, and (3) view-based representation.","291517":"3D models of real-world objects are essential for many applications, including the creation of virtual environments for AI training. To mimic real-world objects in these applications, objects must be annotated with their kinematic mobilities. Annotating kinematic motions is time-consuming, and it is not well-suited to typical crowdsourcing workflows due to the significant domain expertise required. In this paper, we present a system that helps individual expert users rapidly annotate kinematic motions in large 3D shape collections. The organizing concept of our system is motion annotation programs: simple, re-usable procedural rules that generate motion for a given input shape. Our interactive system allows users to author these rules and quickly apply them to collections of functionally-related objects. Using our system, an expert annotated over 1000 joints in under 3 hours. In a user study, participants with no prior experience with our system were able to annotate motions 1.5x faster than with a baseline manual annotation tool.","291536":"Many contemporary signal processing, machine learning and wireless communication applications can be formulated as nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems. Often there is a lack of efficient algorithms for these problems, especially when the optimization variables are nonlinearly coupled in some nonconvex constraints. In this work, we propose an algorithm named penalty dual decomposition (PDD) for these difficult problems and discuss its various applications. The PDD is a double-loop iterative algorithm. Its inner iteration is used to inexactly solve a nonconvex nonsmooth augmented Lagrangian problem via block-coordinate-descent-type methods, while its outer iteration updates the dual variables and\/or a penalty parameter. In Part I of this work, we describe the PDD algorithm and establish its convergence to KKT solutions. In Part II we evaluate the performance of PDD by customizing it to three applications arising from signal processing and wireless communications.","291550":"With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based single-view reconstruction has gained popularity. However, in 3D, there is no absolutely dominant representation that is both computationally efficient and accurate yet allows for reconstructing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. After all, the accurate implicit methods are time-consuming due to dense sampling and inference, while volumetric approaches are fast but limited to heavy memory usage and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose VIPNet, an end-to-end hybrid representation learning for fast and accurate single-view reconstruction under sparse implicit point guidance. Given an image, it first generates a volumetric result. Meanwhile, a corresponding implicit shape representation is learned. To balance the efficiency and accuracy, we adopt PointGenNet to learn some representative points for guiding the voxel refinement with the corresponding sparse implicit inference. A strategy of patch-based synthesis with global-local features under implicit guidance is also applied for reducing memory consumption required to generate high-resolution output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively, which indicates that our proposed hybrid learning outperforms separate representation learning. Specifically, our network not only runs 60 times faster than implicit methods but also contributes to accuracy gains. We hope it will inspire a re-thinking of hybrid representation learning.","291551":"With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based single-view reconstruction has gained popularity.

Active debate has however been had on (i) what the best input modality is to trigger retrieval, and (ii) the ultimate usage scenario for such retrieval. In this paper, we offer a different perspective towards answering these questions \u2013 we study the use of 3D sketches as an input modality and advocate a VR-scenario where retrieval is conducted. Thus, the ultimate vision is that users can freely retrieve a 3D model by air-doodling in a VR environment. As a first stab at this new 3D VR-sketch to 3D shape retrieval problem, we make four contributions. First, we code a VR utility to collect 3D VR-sketches and conduct retrieval. Second, we collect the first set of 167 3D VRsketches on two shape categories from ModelNet. Third, we propose a novel approach to generate a synthetic dataset of human-like 3D sketches of different abstract levels to train deep networks. At last, we compare the common multi-view and volumetric approaches: We show that, in contrast to 3D shape to 3D shape retrieval, volumetric point-based approaches exhibit superior performance on 3D sketch to 3D shape retrieval due to the sparse and abstract nature of 3D VR-sketches. We believe these contributions will collectively serve as enablers for future attempts at this problem.

Nighttime is not only about lowlight and dense noise, but also about glow\/glare, flares, non-uniform distribution of light, etc. One of the possible solutions is to train a network on night stereo images in a fully supervised manner. However, to obtain proper disparity ground-truths that are dense, independent from glare\/glow, and have sufficiently far depth ranges is extremely intractable. To address the problem, we introduce a network joining day\/night translation and stereo. In training the network, our method does not require ground-truth disparities of the night images, or paired day\/night images. We utilize a translation network that can render realistic night stereo images from day stereo images. We then train a stereo network on the rendered night stereo images using the available disparity supervision from the corresponding day stereo images, and simultaneously also train the day\/night translation network. We handle the fake depth problem, which occurs due to the unsupervised\/unpaired translation, for light effects (e.g., glow\/glare) and uninformative regions (e.g., low-light and saturated regions), by adding structure-preservation and weighted-smoothness constraints. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline methods on night images.","293184":"The Internet of Things (IoT) has created a novel ecosystem for sensing and actuation throughout our world, enabling intelligently controlled autonomous systems to conserve energy, water crops, manage factories, and provide situation awareness on an unprecedented scale. As IoT progresses, the interest in IoT search engines, that is, search engines to find IoT devices and retrieve IoT data, has grown. While basic examples of IoT search engines exist, considerable challenges prevent the full realization of an efficient and intelligent IoT search engine that provides universal data service, scalable data communication and retrieval, and efficient querying of massively distributed heterogeneous devices and data. In this article, we first propose a generic framework for the IoT search engine, and then present a naming service for the IoT system, an essential component for an effective IoT search engine. We also outline some research challenges and possible solutions for building efficiency and intelligence in the IoT search engine. Further, we present a case study and seek to address a particular aspect of the query process for IoT search, namely efficient and timely query processing. Given the now obvious advances in machine learning, the potential for deep learning-based prediction to improve resource use, and thus query retrieval, is clear. In detail, we utilize Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to predict aggregated query volumes to be preemptively applied and stored for immediate response. Combining several realistic IoT datasets, we explore the efficacy of simultaneously predicting multiple targets for predictive query retrieval.","293185":"The application of Information Retrieval (IR)
